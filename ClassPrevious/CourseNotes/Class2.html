<h1><a name="01"></a>RCS Programming Notes</h1>

<ol>
    <li>Many people have modified their .login.profile to search
        for ACM versions of programs before RCS versions. This is
        generally nice since the ACM has lots of good programs.
        However, the ACM version of <b>make</b> is incompatible
        with the RCS version. If you use the ACM version, then
        your X programs won't link. There are 2 solutions. </li>
    <li><ol>
            <li>Edit your .login.profile to remove the reference
                to acm, or</li>
            <li>Say <b>/bin/make xhello</b> (or whatever program)
                instead of saying <b>make xhello</b>.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030626014053/http://www.rpi.edu/dept/ecse/cg-s00/Classes/03/demoio.C">demoio.C</a> is a really short program
        that demonstrates input/output in Unix. It reads in
        numbers 3-at-a-time, and writes the product.</li>
    <li>You can use files with it thus:<pre>demoio <infile> OUTFILE
</infile></pre>
    </li>
</ol>

<h1><a name="02"></a>Meta-Learning</h1>

<p>You should be learning about X on three levels. </p>

<ol>
    <li>You're learning a mess of facts about a specific
        important package, X with Motif. (Actually, I'm shielding
        you from much of the mess.) </li>
    <li>You're learning about GUIs in general. Visual C etc has
        things like widgets and callbacks, but the names are
        different.</li>
    <li>You're learning how to learn living, complicated, systems
        in general. The doc is not perfect; things may break if
        you push them too hard, and you have to modify programs
        while only partly understanding them.</li>
</ol>

<h1><a name="03"></a>X Themes</h1>

<ol>
    <li>Client - server.</li>
    <li><ol>
            <li>Client: who does major computation</li>
            <li>Server: controls display</li>
            <li>keyboard, mouse, display &lt;-&gt; server
                &lt;-&gt; client, client, ...</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Server functions:</li>
    <li><ol>
            <li>provides multi-client access</li>
            <li>processes client messages and responds</li>
            <li>draws on display</li>
            <li>maintains local data structures: backing store,
                color maps, fonts, graphics context</li>

            <li>window title bars and their menus</li>
            <li>You can kill the WM, and with luck, restart it or
                another one. Make sure that there will be an
                xterm window on top, or you're dead. If the KB is
                dead, try cutting-and-pasting the command.
                Finally, telnet into the workstation, if that's
                allowed, or call a consultant. </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>X routine hierarchy</li>
    <li><ol>
            <li>Each level has concepts, data types, routines.</li>
            <li>(Lowest level) X ICCCM protocol: events,
                requests, replies, errors.</li>
            <li>Xlib - direct interface</li>
            <li>Xt - adds OO concepts, like the concept of
                widgets, but not specific widgets.</li>
            <li>some widget set: Motif (Xm), Athena (Xaw), etc.</li>
            <li>(Highest level) User program: calls Xm, Xt, Xlib.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<h1><a name="04"></a>Grouping Concepts in X</h1>

<p>X groups related concepts or items whenever possible. Here are
examples:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Widget instances are grouped into widget classes, such as
        the label widget class. All the widgets in one class have
        approximately the same behavior. E.g., the pushbutton
        class accepts mouse button clicks. This also lets you set
        a resource for all the widgets of a given class. The
        following will set the background to green for all label
        widgets, except for mylabel, which will be red. (Specific
        settings override general ones.)<pre>*Label.background: green
*mylabel.background: red
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Related widget classes are grouped into a tree-structured
        hierarchy extending up to the core widget class. They
        inherit properties just as in C++.</li>
    <li>Related programs may be grouped by giving them the same
        class name in XtVaAppInitialize. This lets you set
        resources for all the programs in the class at one time. </li>
    <li>Related resources are grouped into resource classes. This
        lets you set all the resources in the class at once. </li>
</ol>

<p>Class names have their first letter capitalized. If that is
'X', then the first two letters are capitalized. This is not a
law, but merely a convention.</p>

<h1><a name="05"></a>X Man Pages</h1>

<p>Here are a sampling of man pages. </p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030626014053/http://www.rpi.edu/dept/ecse/cg-s00/Classes/03/XtVaAppInitialize.pdf"><tt>XtVaAppInitialize</tt></a>,
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030626014053/http://www.rpi.edu/dept/ecse/cg-s00/Classes/03/XtVaCreateManagedWidget.pdf"><tt>XtVaCreateManagedWidget</tt></a>,
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030626014053/http://www.rpi.edu/dept/ecse/cg-s00/Classes/03/XtRealizeWidget.pdf"><tt>XtRealizeWidget</tt></a>,
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030626014053/http://www.rpi.edu/dept/ecse/cg-s00/Classes/03/XtAppMainLoop.pdf"><tt>XtAppMainLoop</tt></a>,
        and. </li>
    <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030626014053/http://www.rpi.edu/dept/ecse/cg-s00/Classes/03/XtAppAddActions.pdf"><tt>XtAppAddActions</tt></a>.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>I formatted them like this on my private Sun:</p>

<ol>
    <li><pre>cd /afs/rpi.edu/campus/X11/R6/core/1.0/sun4c_41/man/
ptroff -t -man /afs/rpi.edu/campus/X11/R6/core/1.0/sun4c_41/man/man3/-
	XtVaAppInitialize.3 &gt; /dept/ecse/graphics/XtVaAppInitialize.ps</pre>
    </li>
    <li>telnet to rcs.rpi.edu, then run Adobe distill. (Distill
        is installed only on the telnet machines.) </li>
</ol>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Unfortunately, ptroff is not on RCS. You can display the
        man pages on xterm with the man command, after adding the
        appropriate directories to MANPATH, e.g., <p align="center">MANPATH=$MANPATH:/campus/X11/R6/core/1.0/sun4c_41/man<br>
        man XtVaAppInitialize </p>
    </li>
    <li>The SGIs seem to have a brain-damaged version of the <tt>man</tt>
        command, which doesn't do the X pages very well. </li>
    <li>Some of the man pages include other files, which is why I
        cd'ed to the dir above the dir with the man page to
        format it.</li>
    <li>Many routines have alternate versions. To keep things
        sinple, in this case, I present one version in class, and
        ignore the others.</li>
    <li>Nroff/troff implements tables with a preprocessor, which
        much be run first on man pages with tables. It should be
        ok to run it even when there are no tables.</li>
    <li>As usual, the man pages have more info than you need.
        Part of the fun is skimming thru them to get a sense of
        their contents, and then to extract what you need.</li>
</ol>

<h1><a name="06"></a>Adding Translations to Xterm</h1>

<p>Here is an example of using a translation table of event and
actions to add a few things to <code>xterm</code>. Function keys
F2 and F6 cause commands to be entered. F2 is especially useful
inside ftp. If I hold shift down when leaving the window, then
the font is set smaller (assuming that the default font is
small), and if I hold shift down when entering, the font is
restored. <code>string</code> and <code>set-vt-font</code> are
actions defined inside <code>xterm</code>; see the man page. </p>

<pre>XTerm*VT100.Translations:	      #override \
   &lt;Key&gt;F2:		      string("ls -FC") string(0x0d) \n\
   &lt;Key&gt;F6:		      string("date") string(0x0d) \n\
   Shift&lt;Enter&gt;:	      set-vt-font(default) \n\
   Shift&lt;Leave&gt;:	      set-vt-font(1)</pre>

        you want to buy something, look at volume 6a.</li>
    <li>While the above commercial books have more examples and
        explanation, the online docs have more precise info. This
        is because the online docs were written by the people who

<h1><a name="08"></a>Useful X Programs</h1>

<p>Here are a number of somewhat useful programs, some of which
I've mentioned before, to determine information about the system.
See the man pages for a description. E.g., editres displays the
widget tree of another program that is running, and lets you
change that program's resources while it runs. </p>

<h1><a name="09"></a>Xfarewell - Attaching User Defined Actions
to Events</h1>

<p>The program <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030626014053/http://www.rpi.edu/dept/ecse/cg-s00/Classes/03/xfarewell.c">/dept/ecse/graphics/Classes/04/xfarewell.c</a>
with its resource file <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030626014053/http://www.rpi.edu/dept/ecse/cg-s00/Classes/03/XFarewell.ad">/dept/ecse/graphics/Classes/04/XFarewell.ad</a>
illustrate adding a user-defined action to a button or key event
of a pushbutton widget. It shows this: </p>

<p><img src="./Class2_files/xfarewell.gif" width="134" height="51"> </p>

<p>Actions and events are lower-level than callbacks. I.e., they
are messier but more powerful. Also, only callbacks can be
attached to higher-level things such as destroying the widget.</p>

<h1><a name="10"></a>Xbox - Resources, Bulletinboard, Compound
Strings, Popup &amp; Dialog etc.</h1>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030626014053/http://www.rpi.edu/dept/ecse/cg-s00/Classes/03/xbox.c"><tt>/dept/ecse/graphics/Classes/04/xbox.c</tt></a>
illustrates these things: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Setting resources when a widget is created. </li>
    <li>A bulletinboard widget. You have to specify its kids'
        locations explicitly, like pinning a note on a real
        bulletin board. </li>
    <li>Converting a text string to the Motif compound string
        format needed when setting a label inside the program. </li>
    <li>Creating a popup. </li>
    <li>Creating a Motif convenience popup dialog widget. </li>
    <li>Putting callbacks on two of its buttons, and </li>
    <li>Reading the string the user typed in it. </li>
</ol>

<p>There is no resource file. The top-level window is this:</p>

<p><img src="./Class2_files/xbox1.gif" width="171" height="112"></p>

<p>and the popup is this:</p>

<p><img src="./Class2_files/xbox2.gif" width="228" height="143"></p>

<p>The popup has no title bar since I use fvwm, and my .fvwmrc is
set that way.</p>

<h1><a name="11"></a>Children of the Top-Level Widget</h1>

<p>This is relevant to popups, but is messy.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Widget instances form a hierarchy.</li>
    <li>Windows form a hierarchy, starting with the root window.</li>
    <li>A child window is completely contained in its parent.
        Anything outside is clipped.</li>
    <li>The widget hierarchy almost completely matches the window
        hierarchy, with a few exceptions.</li>
    <li>An unrealized widget has no window.</li>
    <li>A popup window is the child of the root window; else it
        would be invisible.</li>
    <li>It doesn't much matter who the parent of the popup widget
        is.</li>
    <li>A toplevel widget can have more than one child widget,
        but its window can have only one child window.</li>
    <li>Any widget children past the first must be popup widgets;
        their windows, when they exist, are children of the root
        window (or window manager if it exists).</li>
</ol>

<p>References: </p>

<p><code>/campus/osf/motif/1.2.2/distrib/src/doc/man/Shell.3X</code>)
says: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>``Shell is a top-level widget (with only one managed
    child) that encapsulates the interaction with the window
    manager.'' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>/campus/osf/motif/1.2.2/distrib/src/doc/programGuide/ch02.sm</code>
says: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>``(The approach described in class) is to designate one
    top-level widget the application, enclosed in an
    ApplicationShell, and make the other TopLevelShells popup
    children of the ApplicationShell. A popup child is one whose
    window is a child of the root window and whose geometry is
    not managed by its parent widget.'' </p>

<p>Extra children might be allowed if unmanaged; we'll ignore
this case. </p>

<h1><a name="12"></a>Font versus FontList</h1>

<p>In general, Athena widget programs use the font resource.
Motif ones take their fonts from a fontList; their default font
is the first one on the list. To make <tt>xhello</tt> use a
different font, add this to <tt>XHello.ad</tt>:<br>
</p>

<p><code>*fontList:7x13</code> </p>

<p>or cut and paste a font from <tt>xfontsel</tt>. That is,</p>

<ol>
    <li>Use <tt>xfontsel</tt> to select a nice font.</li>
    <li>Click on <em>Select</em> to put that font name into the
        server's X selection buffer. (This is somewhat like a cut
        buffer.) </li>
    <li>Use the middle mouse button to paste the selection into
        the editor. This step may fail, in which case you're out
        of luck. </li>
</ol>

<h1><a name="13"></a>C Strings Versus Motif Strings</h1>

<ol>
    <li>This is relevant since some routines require C strings as
        arguments, while others require Motif compound strings. </li>
    <li>C strings are arrays of 8-bit chars. The only structure
        is that many programs assume that there is a null char at
        the end. The chars may be ASCII, which uses 7 bits, with
        the hi bit being 0 or a parity bit. Alternatively, the
        chars may be 8-bit ISO8859, which allows a single byte to
        represent an accented char, such as éèêc, and so on.
        More on this in a later handout.</li>
    <li>Motif compound strings allow wide (16-bit) chars, like
        Kanji, and contain embedded font and direction info.</li>
    <li>C routines like <code>strcpy</code> and <code>strcat</code>
        do not alloc storage. You must do that. They modify their
        first arg.</li>
    <li>Motif routines, like <code>XmStringConcat</code>, do not
        modify their args. They do alloc space for the answer,
        and return a pointer to it. You should free the space
        when you don't need the string any more. However, if you
        free the space too soon, then unpleasant things may
        happen.</li>

        for one example. Now, answer some questions on that.
        These are to be ``back-of-the-envelope'' calculations;
        anything within a factor of 5 of the correct answer is
        ok. In fact, the numbers are so imprecise, that the
        inherent accuracy is probably only a factor of 2. <dl compact="">

        </dl>
    </li>
    <li>Browse the man pages mentioned today, and tell me five
        things that XtVaAppInitialize does. </li>
    <li>Get the files <tt>Makefile</tt>, <tt>xhello.c</tt>, <tt>xgoodbye.c</tt>,
        and <tt>XGoodbye.ad</tt> from
        /dept/ecse/graphics/Classes/02/. Compile and run <tt>xhello</tt>.
        Run it without recompiling with a different foreground
        color, and background color, by specifying extra command
        line arguments. The list of official colors should be in
        /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt. </li>
    <li>Now compile <tt>xgoodbye.c</tt> in the same way as for <tt>xhello</tt>.
        Run it, click on the window that appears, and observe the
        message. Modify the message by editing a file <tt>XGoodbye.ad</tt>
        like the following, but including your name. <p align="center"><tt>*goodbye.labelString: Au Revoir to WRF</tt>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>Extend <tt>xgoodbye.c</tt> by adding several other
        pushbutton widgets, like goodbye, but with names that are
        some top-level options in RPInfo. When it is pressed,
        they should print a string containing the choices at the
        next level, and not quit. E.g., there should be a command
        widget labeled <b>Academics</b> that causes <b>Arch Eng
        Sci Mgt HSS ROTC</b> to be printed. You do not need to be
        exhaustive; it's ok to list only two items in each case.
        Do not do anything like actually calling RPInfo. <p>This
        will require learning and using a composite rowcolumn
        widget under toplevel to hold the other widgets. Do it
        thus: </p>
        <dl compact="">
            <dt>(a) </dt>
            <dd>Include <code>RowColumn.h</code> just as <code>Pushb.h</code>
                . </dd>
            <dt>(b) </dt>
            <dd>Instead of the quit widget being under toplevel,
                create a new widget, called rowcolumn, under
                toplevel. Make its class <code>xmRowColumnWidgetClass</code>.
            </dd>
            <dt>(c) </dt>
            <dd>Make the quit widget, and your new widget, say
                called other, under rowcolumn. </dd>
            <dt>(d) </dt>
            <dd>Add a new routine, like quit, to be called when
                other is pressed. </dd>
            <dt>(e) </dt>
            <dd>Add a callback to this new routine. </dd>
            <dt>(f) </dt>
            <dd>Also add a label widget, like from xhello, under
                rowcolumn. </dd>
            <dt>(g) </dt>
            <dd>If you want to be specific about the string in
                this label widget, you can specify it in <tt>XGoodbye.ad</tt>
                as <p><tt>*goodbye.labelString: I'm the goodbye
                label</tt> </p>
                <p>assuming the widget's name is goodbye.</p>
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </li>
    <li>Make sure that your screen contains both xhello and
        xgoodbye running. Get a screendump and hand it, and the
        program, in. Don't make too many screendumps since each
        one takes several minutes to print. </li>
