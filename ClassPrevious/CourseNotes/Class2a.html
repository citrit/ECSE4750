<h1><a name="01"></a>Online X Documentation</h1>

<p>I found the following with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030912084546/http://www.rpi.edu/dept/ecse/cg-s00/Classes/04/www.google.com">google</a>,
perhaps the most complete current search engine.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030912084546/http://www.motifzone.com/resources/man/top.html">Documentation
for X Window System</a> </p>

<h1><a name="02"></a>Homework 3, Due Tues Feb. 1</h1>

<p>This homework will build on <tt>xbox.c</tt>. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Copy xbox.c to your home directory.</li>
    <li>Compile xbox.c and run it. Click the pressme button and
        then type something in the popup window. When finished
        typing, click on Ok and note that your input is echoed to
        the xterm window. Try clicking on Cancel. When finished
        playing with this, click on Quit.</li>
    <li>Now modify xbox to make it more interesting. Add buttons
        called Date, Ls, and Cat. Date will cause the current
        date to be printed. Ls and Cat will cause a popup window
        to appear and accept the name of a directory (or
        switches) or file respectively. Then they will execute
        those commands. <p>The main routine you need to do this
        is <tt>system</tt>, which executes a command line, just
        as if you typed it to the shell. To form the command line
        for ls and cat, you'll need to concatenate two strings.
        See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030912084546/http://www.rpi.edu/dept/ecse/cg-s00/Classes/04/testsystem.c">testsystem.c</a> for an
        example of system. If all else fails, RTFM.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Get creative and add another function - you choose - to
        the program.</li>
    <li>Put your name somewhere on the screen and make a
        hardcopy. Hand it and your source code in.</li>
    <li>(Non programming questions) Name 3 places where resources
        can be specified.</li>
    <li>Give an advantage and a disadvantage of allowing the user
        to set resources w/o having the source code available.</li>
    <li>Check your books or the online doc, and name 4 things
        that XtVaAppInitialize does.</li>
    <li>Consider the program <tt>xexam.c</tt>. <ol>
            <li>What does this program do?</li>
            <li>Sketch the tree of widgets from the top level
                widget to the leaves. </li>
            <li>How many push button widgets are there? Which
                routine is called when each is clicked on? </li>
            <li>What are the labels that will print in the
                command widgets by default? </li>
            <li>What file where in your account will resources be
                read from (assuming that things are configured as
                I've described in class)? </li>
            <li>Suppose you want to change the label printed
                inside (only) the first leaf widget. Give a
                possible line to add to the resources file. </li>
            <li>Suppose you run the program thus: <tt>xexam -bg
                red</tt>. Where, if anywhere, in your program is
                the bg resource recognized? </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>How can your X program tell the user ran it with
        command-line arguments that are not X resources and
        values? </li>
    <li>In <tt>xgoodbye.c</tt>, why did I place the <tt>Quit</tt>
        routine before <em>main</em>? </li>
    <li>In <tt>xbox.c</tt>, how is the dialog widget created only
        the first time thru? </li>
    <li>What does it mean to <em>manage</em> a widget? </li>
    <li>When you call <tt>XtMainLoop()</tt> your program loses
        control to the X system. Name two ways for it to get back
        control later (without terminating the X system)? </li>
    <li>Why might you want to have the same callback routine for
        more than one widget? </li>
    <li>In the above case, name two ways for the routine to tell
        which widget it is responding to? </li>
    <li>Look at these web sites:</li>

<h1><a name="03"></a>Programming Hints</h1>

<ol>
    <li>When creating a large program, write a little at a time,
        then compile and run it, before adding some more code.
        This is how I modified xtext.</li>
    <li>Compile from within Emacs; it will point you to the error
        lines.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="04"></a>C Char Array Errors</h2>

<p>What's wrong with this (don't hand it in; just think):</p>

<pre>char *c;
c="hello";
c[2]='x';
</pre>

<p>and this:</p>

<pre>char *c;
c="hello";
strcat(c, " to you!");
</pre>

<p>and this:</p>

<pre>char c[20];
c="hello";
strcat(c, " to you!");
</pre>

<h1><a name="05"></a>Security Warning About <tt>system</tt></h1>

<p>Letting people run your homework program above on your account
and provide input, is equivalent to letting them type any command
on your account. If someone types a string with a semicolon to
the program, then system will take the following text as a new
command and run it. That is,</p>

<p><tt>system("ls foo;rm bar");</tt></p>

<p>will cause two commands to be run: ls and bar! This trap also
occurs other places, such as in poorly written WWW CGI-BIN
programs. </p>

<h1><a name="06"></a>X Notes</h1>

<h2><a name="07"></a>Obtaining Info About Widgets</h2>

<p>There are many routines and macros in X to give you info about
your widgets. Here are some. </p>

<ol>
    <li><tt>XtName(w)</tt> returns the name of a widget (i.e.,
        returns a char *) when given a variable of type Widget.
        It can be used to determine which widget a certain
        callback or action occurred on. </li>
    <li><tt>XtParent(w)</tt> returns the parent widget of w. You
        can walk the tree up to the top level widget with this. </li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="08"></a>Portable Programming</h2>

<p>If you try to get an X-Windows program up on three different
platforms (Sun, IBM, and SGI) you'll get a feel for some
portability problems. If you wish to see <tt>config</tt>, a
program that helps other programs to be portable, see my web page
<em>Make, Makefile, and Config Summary</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030912084546/http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/Homepages/wrf/systems/make.html"><tt>http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/Homepages/wrf/systems/make.html</tt></a><tt>
This is enrichment material. </tt></p><tt>

<h2><a name="09"></a>Online Docs</h2>

<p>On the SGIs, you can read a lot of online documentation on X
by starting from the on-screen menu, in two forms: </p>

<ol>
    <li>All the manual pages, </li>
    <li>User manuals and programming manuals, which organize
        material by topic. </li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="10"></a>XmCreatePromptDialog Man Page</h2>

<p>Here are more examples of the online docs. I extracted this
from </p>

<p><tt>/campus/osf/motif/2.0/distrib/src/doc/man/Output/draft/ascii/3X\_04</tt>
</p>

<p>and cleaned it up. Unfortunately, it does not mention that the
widget returned is the dialog box instead of the containing
shell. In fact, the only place where I found that mentioned is in
the O'Reilly Motif Programming Manual. </p>

     NAME
          XmCreatePromptDialog-The SelectionBox PromptDialog
          convenience creation function

     SYNOPSIS
          #include <xm selectiob.h="">

          Widget XmCreatePromptDialog (parent, name, arglist, argcount)
               Widget    parent;
               String    name;
               ArgList   arglist;
               Cardinal  argcount;

     DESCRIPTION
          XmCreatePromptDialog is a convenience creation function that
          creates a DialogShell and an unmanaged SelectionBox child of
          the DialogShell.  A PromptDialog prompts the user for text
          input.  It includes a message, a text input region, and
          three managed buttons.  The default button labels are OK,
          Cancel, and Help.  An additional button, with Apply as the
          default label, is created unmanaged; it may be explicitly
          managed if needed.  One additional WorkArea child may be
          added to the SelectionBox after creation.

          XmCreatePromptDialog forces the value of the SelectionBox
          resource XmNdialogType to XmDIALOG_PROMPT.

          Use XtManageChild to pop up the PromptDialog (passing the
          SelectionBox as the widget parameter); use XtUnmanageChild
          to pop it down.

          XmCreatePromptDialog forces the value of the Shell resource
          XmNallowShellResize to True.

          parent    Specifies the parent widget ID

          name      Specifies the name of the created widget

          arglist   Specifies the argument list

          argcount  Specifies the number of attribute/value pairs in

<h2><a name="11"></a>Shell Widgets</h2>

<p>This is from the OSF/Motif Programmer's Guide, <tt>/campus/osf/motif/2.0/distrib/src/doc/programGuide/Output/draft/ascii/ch02</tt>
</p>

<pre>2.5  Shells

   Users of X Window System applications normally employ a
   window manager, a special application that may control
   the positions, sizes, and border decorations of top-
   level windows on the display.  Motif supplies its own
   window manager, the Motif Window Manager (MWM), but
   Motif applications can cooperate with other window
   managers as well.

   A window manager communicates with other applications
   through a protocol defined in an X Window System
   document, the Inter-Client Communication Conventions
   Manual (ICCCM).  Xt and Motif define a group of widgets
   whose main responsibility is to envelop other widgets
   and communicate with the window manager.  These widgets
   are called shells.

   A shell is nearly invisible to the application.  Each
   shell has a single managed child, and the shell's
   window usually remains coincident with the child's
   window.  The application must create shells when
   needed, but many Motif convenience routines that create
   widgets also create shells automatically.  Once it has
   created a shell, the application may not need to handle
   the shell again.  For example, an application can
   position or resize a Motif shell by positioning or
   resizing the child widget.

   Each widget with a top-level window-that is, a window
   whose parent is the root window of the screen-needs to
   be enclosed in a shell.  This is true of the main
   application widget, but it is also true of dialogs,
   menus, and any top-level widgets other than the main
   application widget.  Motif provides three classes of
   shell: VendorShell, DialogShell, and MenuShell.

2.5.1  VendorShell

   VendorShell is the shell class that provides Motif-
   specific behavior for shells other than those
   surrounding menus.  It is responsible for communication
   between the application and MWM.  VendorShell is a
   superclass for other classes.  TopLevelShell is an Xt
   subclass of VendorShell that surrounds a top-level
   widget in an application.  ApplicationShell is another
   Xt subclass of VendorShell that surrounds the main
   widget in the application.

   Many applications create only one ApplicationShell.  A
   program can create this shell explicitly, or it can use
   the Xt convenience routine XtAppInitialize to
   initialize the application and automatically create the
   ApplicationShell.

2.5.2  DialogShell

   A DialogShell is a VendorShell subclass that envelops
   dialogs.  Although the window manager takes account of
   dialogs, they are usually transient; they appear to
   provide information to or solicit information from the
   user, and then they disappear.  DialogShell is a
   subclass of the Xt TransientShell class, which keeps
   track of the application to which the dialog belongs.

   Users cannot iconify a dialog separately from the main
   application window.

   DialogShell is designed to have a child that is a
   subclass of BulletinBoard.  Most Motif convenience
   routines that create dialogs create DialogShell parents
   automatically.

<h1><a name="12"></a>Program <tt>xtext.c</tt></h1>

<p>This program illustrates several things:</p>

<ol>
    <li>a main window widget, which is a base on which to build
        large apps, </li>
    <li>a text widget for editing text, and getting and setting
        that text from the program, </li>
    <li>H and V scroll bars on a text area, </li>
    <li>pull-down menus, from a menubar widget, </li>
    <li>modifying an existing widget's resources, </li>
    <li>placing one widget relative to another with a form widget
        and attachments, </li>
    <li>popping up an information dialog widget, </li>
    <li>getting the cancel and help button widget addresses for a
        convenience widget, </li>
    <li>unmanaging some widgets to make them invisible, </li>
    <li>popping down a widget by destroying it, </li>
    <li>managing a widget as a separate call after creating it,
        which is necessary for some convenience widgets, since
        there is no single routine given to create and manage
        them, </li>
    <li>using the same callback routine for two widgets, with the
        user data field in <tt>XtAddCallback</tt> distinguishing
        them, </li>
</ol>

<p>A good reference is chapter 4 of O'Reilly volume 6A.</p>

<h1><a name="13"></a>Program <tt>editres</tt></h1>

<p><tt>editres</tt> lets you display the tree of widgets, showing
their names or classes. You can also change some resource values
in a running program. Programs compiled on the SGIs will talk to <tt>editres</tt>.
However, on some other platforms, you must make two additions to
a program that is to talk to <tt>editres</tt>. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Add this declaration near the top.<p><tt>extern void
        _XEditResCheckMessages();</tt></p>
    </li>
    <li>Add this sometime before the end.<p><tt>XtAddEventHandler(top_level_widget,
        (EventMask)0, True, _XEditResCheckMessages, NULL); </tt></p>
        <p><tt>top_level_widget</tt> should be the top level
        widget. If want to be able to click on popups, do this
        for each popup also.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Search another library, <tt>-lXmu</tt>, when linking,
        after <tt>-lXm</tt>. I've done this to my makefiles. </li>
    <li>Compile the program. </li>
    <li>Read its man page and thatof <tt>editres</tt>. </li>
</ol>

<p>Here the tree of xbox widgets, after the popup widget was
created. </p>

<p><img src="./Class2a_files/xbox_editres.gif" width="506" height="480"> </p>

<p>This is the same tree, but showing classes. </p>

<p><img src="./Class2a_files/xbox_editres_class.gif" width="653" height="533"> </p>

<p>You can also display a widget's resources, and change many of
them.</p>

<p>If you get the widget tree on <tt>xtext</tt> before and after
hitting the help button the first time, you'll notice that a lot
more widgets appear. </p>

<h1><a name="14"></a>Filler -- Gelernter on the Beauty of
Software</h1>

<p><font size="2">``Most computer technologists don't like to
discuss it, but the importance of beauty is a consistent (if
sometimes inconspicuous) thread in the software literature.
Beauty is more important in computing than anywhere else in
technology... Beauty is important in engineering terms because
software is so complicated... Beauty is our most reliable guide
to achieving software's ultimate goal: to break free of the
computer, to break free conceptually. Software is stuff unlike
any other... Software's goal is to escape this gravity field, and
every key step in software history has been a step away from the
computer, toward forgetting about the machine and its physical
structure and limitations -- forgetting that it can hold only so
many bytes, that its memory is made of fixed size cells, that you
refer to each cell by a numerical address. Software needn't
accept those rules and limitations. But as we throw off the
limits, what guides us? How do we know where to head? Beauty is
the best guide we have.'' (Adapted from ``Machine Beauty:
Elegance and the Heart of Computing,'' by David Gelernter,
