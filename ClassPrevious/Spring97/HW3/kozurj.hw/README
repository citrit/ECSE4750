Here is project 3, these were all done on an IBM AIX workstation.  There aren't
any probles as far as I can tell, although the animation is pretty slow so I
only have 5 shots for each sequence.  I don't have the time or patience to
figure out the requirements of the last 2 filters, so theres no bonus stuff.

p2b = stream
