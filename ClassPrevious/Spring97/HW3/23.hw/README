it's assumed that those will be supplied...

The Sample and MRIHead decimation files are respectively labeled MRIdec.tcl
and Sample_dec.tcl. The do have the same animation potential as the 
Sample.tcl and MRIHead.tcl but it was determine (by myself) that it would
be better to have the animation in the decimated one turned off so one 
can see the HUGE improvement in turning and rendering etc.

That's about it... The code here is pretty much based off of the pre-existing
code given with few modifications.
