#
# Sample Makefile for compilling the sample code for the
# Advanced Computer Graphics and Data Visualization 35.6961 (Fall 1995)
#
# Copy this to the directory where the program resides and use
#  
#       make progname
#
# The progname would be the prefix of the source file you generated.
# Like if your source file was hw1.c, the above line would read:
#
#       make hw1
#
# The make utility would automatically look for something with a suffix
# it understood and would find hw1.c. There are built in rules which
# tell it how to compile c source.
