Homework #1
Advanced Graphics


1. I need to create an abstract class to hold all the common data between Sphere, Box, and Cone. Common data includes positions for rotations and translations, the material settings, etc.. 


2. The lighting is still a little off; it's an "art" as the book says. I still want to play around with this...


3. The way to rotate the objects was not specified in the homework, so I took the liberty of varying it:
	BOX - rotates about the x,y,z axes
	CONE - rotates "down" the cone on the x,y axes
	SPHERE - rotates y,z axes
The objects did some interesting things when, while I was diddling with the code, they intersected. @:)
