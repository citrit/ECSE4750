<h2>Example of Simulations and Visualizations:</h2>
<h3>Fresnel Concentrator</h3>
<p>Fresnel concentrator is an array of 121 mirror facets on a fixed array of rows. Prof. David Borton of Mechanical 
engineering wanted to show the mechanics of how the facets were unable to focus the suns rays at certain times of the 
year. He did the math involved and created a spreadsheet of numbers explaining his results. This graphic visualizes the 
motion of an 11 by 11 array of mirrors throughout a solar year. The declination of the sun changes +/- 23.5 degrees 
with the seasons. The change of the focus can be adjusted depending on the energy requirements of the solar thermal 
application from steam heat to electricity to chemical processing. </p>

<h3>MRI Data and 3D Model simulation</h3>
<p>This animation uses a MRI data set and a model created with AutoCAD and integrates them into a simulation of how 
an MRI acquires data.</p>
