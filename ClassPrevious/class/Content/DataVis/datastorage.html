<h2>&nbsp;Section 2: Data Storage Algorithms</h2>

<h3>&nbsp; Data Representation</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Now with our understanding of how to map geometric
        primitives to the screen, we need methods by which we can
        efficiently store the necessary information to recreate
        large geometric representations of our visualizations.</li>
    <li>Since our goal is data visualization, we first we need to
        understand our data. This may sound easy, but in practice
        this becomes the main issue in creating a visualization</li>
    <li>The choice of data storage methods is important because
        it affects our ability to interface to external data and
        the overall performance of the entire visualization
        system. We will want to keep a few guidelines for <b>design
        criterion</b>:</li>
</ul>

<dl>
    <dt><b><i>Compact</i></b></dt>
    <dd>Since we know visualization data tends to be very large,
        we need to design our structures to minimize computer
        memory requirements.&nbsp;</dd>
    <dt><b><i>Efficient</i></b></dt>
    <dd>Visualization data needs to be accessed many times and we
        would like to retrieve and store data in our structures
        in constant time.&nbsp;</dd>
    <dt><b><i>Mappable</i></b></dt>
    <dd>Data representations need to efficiently map into
        graphics primitives. We must be able to easily convert
        external data into internal visualization data
        structures.&nbsp;</dd>
    <dt><b><i>Minimal Coverage</i></b></dt>
    <dd>We must create a data representation that minimizes the
        number of data types while covering a large portion of
        external data types. We wish to balance efficiency with
        the number of data types.&nbsp;</dd>
    <dt><b><i>Simple</i></b></dt>
    <dd>Simple algorithms and data sets are easier to implement
        and also easier to extend.&nbsp;</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Data Set</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The Dataset is an abstract form which simply defines the
        concept of the behavior of the concrete derived classes
        to follow.</li>
    <li>The data set consists of two sections: the <b><i>Structure</i></b>
        and <b><i>Attributes</i></b>.</li>
    <li><b><i>Structure</i></b> consist of two elements: <i>Topology</i>
        and <i>Geometry</i></li>
    <li><ol>
            <li><i>Topology</i> is the information about the
                structure of the dataset.</li>
            <li><i>Geometry</i> is the instantiation of the
                Topology</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The best way to think of it is if we say a polygon is a
        triangle, we specified the topology. When we provide the
        point coordinates we specify the geometry.</li>
    <li><b><i>Attributes</i></b> are supplemental information
        associated with the geometry such as temperature,
        pressure, or density. They consist of scalars, vectors,
        normals, texture coordinates, tensors, and user defined
        data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cell Types</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Data sets consist of one or more cells which are the
        fundamental building blocks of visualization systems.</li>
    <li>Cells are defined by specifying a <i>type</i> in
        combination with an ordered list of points (<i>connectivity
        list</i>) which implicitly defines the topology of the
        cell.</li>
    <li>Examples of Cell types are:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <p><tt>Vertex PolyVertex Line PolyLine<br>
    Triangle TriangleStrip Quadrilateran<br>
    Polygon Tetrahedron Hexahedron Voxel</tt></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Attribute Data</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Attribute data is information associated with the
        structure of the data set. It can be bound to the
        topology, such as a face color, or assigned to the
        underlying geometry, such as temperatures of points. This
        data is an attribute to the structure of the dataset.</li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><img src="images/vector.gif" alt="Vector data"
width="784" height="392"></p>

<ul>
    <li>We need a way to associate the attribute data with the
        same overall constraints we defined for the container
        objects.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3><font size="4">Example implementation: Open Inventor</font></h3>

<ul>
    <li>Open Inventor is an object-oriented toolkit for
        developing interactive, 3D graphics applications. It also
        defines a standard file format for exchanging 3D data
        among applications. </li>
    <li>Scene graphs describe geometry and attributes</li>
    <li>They use a graph (usually a directed acyclic graph) to
        relate/bind attributes and geometry.</li>
    <li>Graphical objects (nodes) are organized into a
        hierarchical graph</li>
    <li>The path to any node on the graph defines the attributes
        of that node</li>
    <li>For example a Rotation or Material node will affect the
        nodes after it in the scene</li>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Strengths</strong>: <ul>
            <li>Reuse of properties and transformations reduce
                storage and rendering times</li>
            <li>State based drawing paradigm is very fast</li>
            <li>Hierarchical model allows grouping of nodes</li>
            <li>It can be part of a larger OO package</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Weakness</strong>: <ul>
            <li>It is a recursive traversal model, overhead
                involved - pushing &amp; popping the execution
                state</li>
            <li>Geometry nodes are effected by
                &#147;unknown&#148; nodes prior in the tree</li>
            <li>Cannot render &quot;out of order&quot;, always a
                left to right rendering order<ul>
                    <li>Cannot perform parrallel rendering</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>It is difficult to understand, great deal of
                nuance</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Scene Graphs serve best as scene description formats</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example Implementation: Java3D</h3>

<ul>
    <li>We will look into Java3D which is a move away from the
        traditional SG of Inventor towards a more object based
        rendering system</li>
    <li><a
        href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/forDevelopers/3Dguide/Intro.doc.html">Java3D</a>
        is an extension to the Java language specification and is
        found at:<ul>
            <li><a
                href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/index.html">http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/index.html</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>First we will look at the <a
        href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/forDevelopers/3Dguide/SceneGraphOverview.doc.html"><font
        size="3">Scene Graph Overview</font></a></li>
    <li>Which is organized by the <a
        href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/forDevelopers/3Dguide/GroupNodes.doc.html"><font
        size="3">Group Node Objects</font></a></li>

        size="3">Leaf Node Objects</font></a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Recipe for Java 3D Program</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The following steps are taken by the example program to
        create the scene graph elements and link them together.
        Java 3D will then render the scene graph and display the
        graphics in a window on the screen: </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <p>1. Create a Canvas3D object and add it to the Applet panel
    or a frame. </p>
    <p>2. Create a BranchGroup as the root of the scene branch
    graph. </p>
    <p>3. Construct a shape node with a transform above it. </p>
    <p>4. Attach a RotationInterpolator behavior to the
    transform. </p>
    <p>5. Call the universe builder utility function to do the
    following: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>a. Establish a virtual universe with a single
        high-resolution Locale </p>
        <p>b. Create the PhysicalBody, PhysicalEnvironment, View
        and ViewPlatform objects. </p>
        <p>c. Create a BranchGroup as the root of the view
        platform branch graph. </p>
        <p>d. Insert the view platform branch graph into the
        Locale. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>6. Insert the scene branch graph into the universe
    builder's Locale. </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
    <li>The Java 3D renderer then starts running in an infinite
        loop. The renderer conceptually performs the following
        operations: </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<blockquote>
    <pre>while(true) {</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <pre>    Process input
    If (request to exit) break
    Perform Behaviors
    Traverse the scene graph and render visible objects
}</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <pre>Cleanup and exit</pre>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<ul>
    <li><pre><font size="3">and of course when we apply all these principles we get HomeWork 1</font></pre>

<h3>Example Implementation: Our Rendering System</h3>

<ul>
    <li>We need to keep in mind our design criteria<ul>
            <li><em><strong>Compact, Efficient, Mappable, Minimal
                Coverage, and Simple</strong></em></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Some issues to keep in mind when creating a rendering
        system:<ul>
            <li>Create building block type objects that can be
                organized and subclassed to create any shape we
                need</li>
            <li>Keep them extendable (topology and geometry)</li>
            <li>We need to be able to position and move these
                basic shapes</li>
            <li>We need to assign colors (per vertex,
                single/double sided, smooth coloring)</li>
            <li>We need to keep track of lights and viewer
                position</li>
            <li>We may want to develop our code to work cross
                platforms</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Based on these and other issues, the following class
        hierarchy was devloped to illustrate the above points</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="images/oglrrensys.gif" width="640" height="512"></p>

<h3>The ParentObject Class</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The Parent Object defines some basic behavior of all
        objects in our system</li>
    <li>It also allows us to gather up any object for later
        processing</li>
    <li>It specifies some helpfull methods for later use</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Cell Class (Topology)</h3>

<ul>
    <li>This is the base class for all basic building blocks in
        the system</li>
    <li>It defines behaviors and implicit information for all
        topology objects</li>
    <li>The Render method is the way the Renderer signals the
        objects to draw themselves</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Points Classes (Geometry)</h3>

<ul>
    <li>These define how geometry is stored in the system</li>
    <li>Basically simple storage objects</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Material Classes</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Define how colors are stored in our system, allow the
        user to define various variables associated with color
        models</li>
    <li>Allow for per-face or per-vertex coloring</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rendering System Abstraction Layer</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Defines how the rendering system organizes the scene</li>
    <li>Includes actors, cameras and lights</li>
    <li>Specifies a collection method for all instances of
        objects to be referenced later</li>
    <li>Defines the API for Cells to draw themselves</li>
    <li>Basically a collection object with Graphics methods</li>
</ul>

<h3>Specific Rendering Implementation Layer</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Ties our abstraction layer to a real rendering API</li>
    <li>We need to translate our API methods in the abstract
        layer to actual functions within the graphics API</li>
    <li>Also need to tie down any specific finctionality of
        lights, cameras, and actors that may apply to the
        specified rendering system</li>
</ul>
