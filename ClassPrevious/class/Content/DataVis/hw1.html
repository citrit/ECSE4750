<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Write a Java program that changes the behaviour of one of the
example programs. Your program should open a window with a double
buffered visual. The program should initially draw three objects:
a solid red cube with a shiny surface, a solid blue cone 2 units
to the right of the cube with a rough surface, and a yellow
sphere 2 units to the left of the cube.</p>

<p>The program should allow movement of the viewpoint of the
observer (camera point) and also be able to rotate each object
independent of the others (similar to Simple3.java).</p>

<p><b><i>Hints</i></b>: Create global state variables for each
object or build a state structure. Use the Java menu system for
toggling various states and which shape should rotate.</p>

<p><b><i>Extra credit</i></b>: Move and scale each object and/or
switch between single and double buffered and/or add transparency
to the sphere.</p>

<p><b><i>Submission of Homework</i></b>: All homeworks will be
submitted via email. Please name your code Hw1.java which should
contain a class called Hw1 which will most likely extend the
JoglCanvas. The main method should be part of the Hw1 class.
Attach your Java source file to your email submision. The subject
line of your email message should read &quot;Home Work 1&quot;. I
am attempting to automate the grading process as much as
possible, please ask me if you do not understand these
instructions. </p>
