<p><b>DESCRIPTION:</b> </p>

<p>The course will cover topics associated with advanced computer
graphics including Graphical Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs)
such as OpenGL, hi performance graphics engines and visualization
pipelines. There will be a section on cross platform development
and issues involved with porting graphics software. The course
will also explore algorithms for extracting visual information
from data sets, such as marching cubes, used for determining iso-surfaces,
contours, and cut planes. There will be a short overview of
Object Oriented design and Object Oriented systems followed by a
section on creating visualizations using packages such as
IRISExplorer and object oriented software libraries such as VTK
and Open Inventor. The course will conclude with a term project
in which the student models a real world phenomenon using any of
the applications covered in class. Term project required. Prereqs:
35.475 Computer Graphics, 66.436 Data Structures or equivalent,
some familiarity with Java/C++. <br>
</p>

<p><b>FACILITIES:</b> </p>

<p>We will be developing code in a generic manner in which any
available computer that supports OpenGL can be used.</p>

<p><b>Term Project:</b> </p>

<p>There will be a term project due at the end of the semester.
The project will require the use of one of the visualization
tools discussed to create an animation of some physical phenomena.
The animation will need to include certain aspects of
visualization and animation, these criteria will be specified at
a later time. </p>

<p><b>Homework:</b> </p>

<p>There will be seven programming homework assignments spaced
over the semester. They are due the following Tuesday at
midnight, this means you have one week to complete the
assignments. The assignments will cover the current topic listed
above. There are also in class modules to augment the course
notes. There is no collaboration on homework assignments, you may
discuss general topics or methods of solving a problem in groups
but the final homework submission needs to be your own work.</p>

<p><b>Policies:</b> </p>

<p><i>Late submissions</i>: In order to receive any grade on a
project, you must submit something by the deadline. If your
project is not completed by the deadline, you should submit what
you have at that time. You will be able to submit additions/corrections
after the deadline to improve your grade. But the best policy is
to get the work completed by the deadline. There will be a 5%
deduction from your grade for every day it is late. </p>

<p><em>Do your own work</em>: I am a professional developer. I
look at code all day and understand program flow and programming
paradigms. I have a nack for remembering code I have written so
please do not find one of my old solutions and change the
variables and hand it in as your own. This will mean a zero for
the assignment and possible reporting to the office of student
affairs.</p>

<p><i>Collaboration on the Final Project</i>: There will be a
complete description of the project and how the grouping will
work. Details to follow. </p>

<p><b>Grading:</b> </p>

<p>The grading for the course will be weighted as follows: </p>
