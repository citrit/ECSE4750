<h2 align="center">Term Project</h2>

<p align="center">Due: April 27, 2001</p>

<hr>

<p>The term project should conform to the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The project should create a 3D visual based on some real
        world phenomena (i.e. lightning, thunderstorm, growth of
        mold, plasma flow inside a nuclear reactor, heating of
        toast in a toaster, etc.) </li>
    <li>It can be based on a data set or an algorithm. </li>
    <li>It should be a 3D rendering. </li>
    <li>It should contain an animation sequence. This sequence
        should incorporate these characteristics: <ul>
            <li>The view point should change over time. </li>
            <li>The data model should change over time (i.e. if
                its a time series the data changes over time, if
                its a static model a cut plane should pass
                through it or transparency added). </li>
            <li>There should be some annotation information (i.e.
                text banners, color bar, legend, axis). </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The final output will be an MPEG file of your animation
        and should contain explanatory information about your
        rendering (e.g. text frames). We will be going over how
        to make an MPEG using all the various visualization
        systems in class. </li>
</ul>

<p>You are free to work on a project based on your own interests
and major. Just simply make sure all the above criteria are
included. Please check out your choice of a term project with me
by either sending me email, calling, or stopping by during office
hours. You can also work in groups of two or three if there are
others who are interested in the same material and project.</p>
