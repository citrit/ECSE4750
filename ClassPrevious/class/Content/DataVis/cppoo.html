<h3>Intro to C++ and Object Oriented Design</h3>
<p>&#160; </p>
<ul>
    <li>terminology needed for C++ aspects of class projects:
        <ul>
            <li>class, derived class, base class, method, virtual
                function, pure virtual function, overloaded
                operator, <br>
                polymorphism, templates</li>
            <li>Basic code examples...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160; </p>
    </li>
    <li>Object Oriented design changes the way you think about a
        problem.
        <ul>
            <li>Think more about the problem in the pre-planning
                stages</li>
            <li>Create APIs to define how objects interact</li>
            <li>Specific to our task, decide weather to
                encapsulate behaviors and methods with data</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Objects are the main building blocks, we can think of
        objects as<br>
        <em>an abstraction that models the state and behavior of
        entitities in a system</em></li>
    <li>We need to map our program and its behavior, real world
        or simulated, to objects</li>
    <li>We will use terminology introduced by Rumbaugh where
        objects have:
        <ul>
            <li><em><strong>attributes</strong></em> - also
                called instance variables, these can be data
                types of the language (i.e. char, float)</li>
            <li><em><strong>methods</strong></em> - these define
                behavior by the operation or transformations that
                can be applied to the object.</li>
            <li><em><strong>object classes</strong></em> -
                grouping mechanism by which objects share similar
                properties, these objects classes specify class
                names, not specific values (<em>base classes</em>)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Re-use becomes a major factor in planning your OO class
        structure, why do things twice</li>
    <li>Inheritance is also important in that it gives us the
        ability to create new classes that differ slightly from
        pre-existing class</li>
    <li>After a lot of thought goes into your class structure,
        you hope to have them organized into a meaningful
        inheritance hierarchy, this can be accomplished in two
        ways:
        <ul>
            <li><em><strong>Specialization</strong></em> -
                creating the hierarchy from the top down</li>
            <li><em><strong>Generalization</strong></em> -
                creating the hierarchy from the bottom up</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In general if we use these methods, our end product will
        consist of:
        <ul>
            <li>base classes - abstract classes that define
                object attributes and methods</li>
            <li>derived classes - classes that use/combine
                various base classes through inheritance</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>There are many OO languages available, each with its own
        strengths and weaknesses</li>
    <li>OO is a move away from procedural oriented systems by
        encapsulating data with methods</li>
    <li>If we were creating a drawing program that has many basic
        shapes, a procedural approach would be:
        <pre>Primative *aPrim;
...
DrawPrimative(aPrim);
...
procedure DrawPrimitive(Primative *aPrim) {
   switch (aPrim-&gt;type) {
   case SQUARE:
	DrawSquare(aPrim);break;
   case CIRCLE:
	DrawCircle(aPrim);break;
   ...
   }
} </pre>
    </li>
    <li>&#160;The obvious short fall of this method is if we add
        more shapes, we will need to edit this fragment of code
        to handle these new shapes</li>
    <li>An OO approach would be to create a base class, lets call
        it shape, and derive actual geometry primitives from this
        one class</li>
    <li>We can then create a collection object that will keep
        track of these many shapes and will call each objects
        draw method</li>
    <li>We can then create new derived geometry shapes and the
        collection object will require no changes</li>
    <li>
        <p align="left">A C++ example would be:<center> </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" width="90%">
    <tr>
        <td width="50%"><div align="left"> 
        <pre>class Shape () {
   virtual void Draw() = 0;
}; </pre>
        </div> <div align="left"> 
        <pre>class Circle : public Shape {
   void Draw() {
        doSomethingToDrawACircle();
   }
}; </pre>
        </div> </td>
        <td width="50%"><div align="left"> 
        <pre>class ShapeCollection {
public:
   void DrawShapes() {
	for (i=0;i&gt;Shapes.Count();i++)
	   Shapes[i]-&gt;Draw();
   }
   void AddShape(Shape *shp) {
	Shapes.Add(shp);
   }
private:
   CollectionClass&lt;Shape *&gt;  Shapes;
}; </pre>
        </div> </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p align="left"></center></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p align="left">We can then create more shapes based on
        the Shape base class and simply add them to the
        ShapeCollection object </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <pre>class MeshClass : public Shape {
public:
   void Draw() {
       doLotsofDrawingThings();
   }
};</pre>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>We can also create new classes based on previously
        defined shapes, say we wanted to create a face with eyes</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <pre>class Face : public Circle {
public:
    void Draw() {
	Circle::Draw();  // First draw the outside, this class has all circle data values
	PositionLeftEye();
	Eyes[0].Draw();
	PositionRightEye();
	Eyes[1].Draw();
     }
private:
     Circle Eyes[2];
};</pre>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>What is the shortcomming of this method? What are we
        forgetting?</li>
    <li>What else can be done to help this object implicitly
        represent itself?</li>
    <li>At run time we use the collection object to hold pointers
        to all dynamically created shape objects</li>
    <li>Whenever we need to redraw the screen, the collection
        object sends each shape a Draw method</li>
    <li>The next step is to take this abstraction and expand it
        to extract more behaviors, such as:
        <ul>
            <li>How do shapes draw themselves?</li>
            <li>Where do they draw to?</li>
            <li>How does the graphics system get initialized?</li>
            <li>How do the shape objects get initialized?</li>
            <li>What about scale, orientation, movement, color,
                material properties?</li>
            <li>What other base classes do we need to render the
                graphics to a final image?</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
