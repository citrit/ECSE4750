<p align="center"><strong>Homework 4 Due: December 5, 1995 </strong></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>This homework requires you to use the VTK library in order to
load and display a MRI data file. The template Makefile and data
files are in: </p>
<p>~citrit/public/VisClass/C++/hw4 </p>
<p>You need to create source that will load the data file into a
Scalar object and create a pipeline to render an isosurface. The
objects you will need are: </p>
<pre>	vtkRenderMaster		vtkActor
	vtkRenderWindow		vtkStructuredPoints
	vtkRenderer		vtkShortScalars 
	vtkMarchingCubes	vtkPolyMapper
	vtkRenderWindowInteractor </pre>
<p>All these objects are described in the text in the man pages
at the end of the book. There are example programs that use the
VTK library in: </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>/campus/visualization/vtk/1.1/common/examples/cc </p>
</blockquote>
<p>directory. Look through these to get a feel for how to use the
objects and to create the dependancy pipeline. The data file is
called MRIdata.bin and it contains a subsampled version of an MRI
scan of a human head. It is a 64 x 64 x 27 regularly spaced grid.
The data values in the file are shorts and are in row major
order. </p>
<p>Use 225.0 as the initial isosurface value, this should render
a recognizable image. </p>
<p>Please shar up only your source code. Some people sent me the
object code in the last homework and shar did not work. Simply do
a &quot;make clean&quot; before archiving and mailing your code.
The Makefile's will place your object code in the /tmp directory,
remeber to run it by using /tmp/hw4. If you are having problems
with space, please see me.</p>
