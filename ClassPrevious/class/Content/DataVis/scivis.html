<h3><a name="What is Scientific Visualization">What is Scientific Visualization</a></h3>
<p><b>Definitions: </b><cite><b>0</b></cite><b> </b></p>
<ul>
<li>In general terms, Scientific Visualization can be thought of as any method which presents scientific information in 
a manner to facilitate the conceptualization of scientific phenomenon or statistical information. With advances in 
computational speeds and display technology, sci-vis has experienced a revolution. Historical methods of sci-vis 
have not become obsolete however. Graph paper and oscilloscopes have been key sci-vis tools for years, and 
continue to be so. Scientific visualization may take advantage of any of the human senses. Sound has been used 
as a sci-vis tool for years and is still an area of active research. New techniques are being studied which employ 
the sense of feel, including force-feedback systems to help &quot;feel&quot; the strength of a bond between atoms, or feel 
the molecular surface of a tooth. </li>

<h3><a name="Contours">Contours</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Given a set of samples taken over a presumably continuous region, it is meaningful to consider drawing smooth 
lines connecting together the locations on the grid containing the same data values. You are probably familiar 
with topographic maps that show contour lines connecting together the same values of altitude of the Earth's 
surface features, such as hills and valleys. These lines are called &quot;contour lines&quot; or &quot;isolines&quot; (iso means &quot;same&quot; or 
&quot;equal&quot;). In most cases, the places on the surface of the sample grid that have identical data values will not 
coincide with the grid sample points. While there is a direct correspondence between the actual appearance in 
nature of these hills and valleys and a contour map of the region, when we plot an abstract data value such as 
&quot;number of species of grass&quot; on a sample grid then connect with lines those data grid areas having the same 
number of grass species, we are performing visualization.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Isosurfaces">Isosurfaces</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When we have collected data throughout a three-dimensional space, we can identify volumetric elements defined 
by connecting adjacent grid sample points in three dimensions using a &quot;connections&quot; component like cubes. It 
now becomes possible to draw &quot;isosurfaces&quot; rather than &quot;isolines.&quot; An isosurface is that surface cutting through a 
volume on which all data values are equal to a specified value. Depending on the actual distribution of the data, 
isosurfaces may look more or less like flat sheets (the isosurface of &quot;sea level&quot; in a data set of altitudes would 
look like this), or an isosurface might enclose a portion of our space, or an isosurface may appear as a whole set 
of small disconnected surfaces or enclosed spaces. To create an isosurface, we pick a value of interest. Let's say 
that according to our knowledge of meteorology, we know that the dew point (at which water condenses from 
vapor to liquid) is at 12 degrees C in our sample. Although we measured temperatures at only a fixed number of 
grid points, we are interested in seeing where rain formation may begin throughout the atmosphere. We could 
show only the sample points highlighted by themselves, but once again, we make a reasonable assumption that 
we have taken discrete samples from a continuous natural volume. In other words, rain formation will not simply 
occur at the limited set of discrete points where we have sampled temperatures of 12 degrees C, but at all the 
points in between that are also at 12 degrees. How do we find all those in-between points? By interpolating 
through the volumetric elements between adjacent sample points.</li>

<h3><a name="Color Mapping">Color Mapping</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A colormap represents a relationship between a continuous range of floating point numeric data values and a set 
of color values. Frequently, you'll encounter colormaps with continuous (&quot;spectral&quot;) color tones like a rainbow, 
but there is no requirement that colormaps appear continuous. Each colormap has associated with it a minimum 
and a maximum scalar value. The range over which these colors are mapped normally includes the whole range 
of measured values, you can also specify smaller ranges to highlight areas of interest.</li>
</ul>
<h3 align=center><img src="images/colmap.gif" alt="ColorMap" align=bottom width=343 height=319></h3>
<h3><a name="Rendering">Rendering</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The process of converting geometric data into an image which involves organizing the data into a formatted style, 
extracting the necessary information, mapping the data to a visual. This is referred to as a visualization pipeline. 
Using OO technology we can separate these steps and replace any one link in the pipeline with other filters or 
data types.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Volume Rendering">Volume Rendering</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Another way to examine data collected throughout a volume of space. Imagine a glass bowl full of lemon gelatin. 
Holding it up to a light, you can see through the gelatin because it is somewhat translucent. Now imagine that 
you've added strawberries to the bowl of gelatin before it set up. You can see the strawberries embedded in the 
gelatin. What is really happening, visually? Light shines through the mass of gelatin &quot;accumulating&quot; color. If you 
look through the top corner, it will appear somewhat less yellow than if you look through the thickest part. If the 
light strikes a strawberry as it passes through the gelatin, your eyes will detect an orange object with a distinct 
outline, which of course enables us to find the location of the strawberries in the volume of gelatin. The 
strawberry appears orange because its red color is partly occluded by the yellow gelatin: nevertheless, our brains 
convert the strawberry color back to red because it is a familiar object. If someone has added a fruit unfamiliar 
to you, you will have a hard time identifying the true color of the fruit, since our brains are not good at performing 
subtractive color calculations. Volume rendering a data space yields an image something like our bowl of gelatin. 
By default, a volume rendering appears somewhat transparent. As light passes through from behind the volume 
toward your eye, it is absorbed more in areas of densely concentrated values. These areas will appear to be 
more &quot;opaque.&quot; If you colormap your volume according to the data component, you will see indistinct colored 
areas in their relation to each other.</li>

<h3><a name="Marching Cubes">Marching Cubes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Marching cubes creates surface models of constant density from 3-D data that has connectivity. The algorithm 
determines how the surface intersects one cube, created from eight pixels, and then moves (or marches) to the 
next cube. The cubes share edges which ensures that the surfaces created will always connect between adjacent 
cubes. This is the main algorithm used for IsoSurface generation.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Visualization Pipeline">Visualization Pipeline</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The visualization pipeline consists of objects to represent data (data objects) objects to operate on data (process 
objects), and an indicated direction of data flow (arrowed connections between objects). Data objects represent 
information and provide methods to create, access, and delete this information. Process objects operate on input 
data to generate output data. A process object either derives new data from its inputs, or transforms the input 
data into a new form.</li>

irregular intervals and show the topography of the land. Here is an example of positional information associated 
with molecular positions of a methanol molecule. The Scalar value would be used to color the individual points 
according to the current color mapping.</li>

<h3><a name="Structured Grid">Structured Grid</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Structured grids are made up of similar building blocks, such as cubes, forming hexahedral cells. This is the most 
commonly used form of volumetric data and is also the easiest to manipulate. A common example is taking air 
samples at a regular interval through a gaseous cloud and representing the readings on a regular grid. This would 
contain an n by m matrix of values which would be extended over several layers. Here is an example of a 2 x 3 x 
4 regular grid:</li>

<h3><a name="Unstructured Grid">Unstructured Grid</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Unstructured Grids represent geometry as points (or nodes) and elements. The points are defined by a positive, 
arbitrary integer id and a triplet of floats representing position. The elements can be any of a set of shapes such 
as a single point, a line element defined by two nodes, a triangle element defined by three nodes, a quadrilateral 
element defined by four element, a brick element defined by eight points, a wedge element defined by 6 
elements, a pyramid defined by four points that form the base and a fifth point at the peak, and so on. Here is an 
example of an unstructured grid with irregular connections and irregular positions.</li>

<h3><a name="Vector Data">Vector Data</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Vector data is generally associated with a geometry and provides a triplet of values for each point in the 
geometry. This would be to specify a direction and magnitude at each point. This is useful for air flow 
visualizations and Finite Element calculations showing force directions and magnitude. Here is a visualization of a 
thunder cloud showing an isosurface of a specific moisture value and glyphs (arrows) showing the direction and 
magnitude of the airflow inside the cloud.</li>

<h2>Example of Simulations and Visualizations:</h2>
<h3>Fresnel Concentrator</h3>
<p>Fresnel concentrator is an array of 121 mirror facets on a fixed array of rows. Prof. David Borton of Mechanical 
engineering wanted to show the mechanics of how the facets were unable to focus the suns rays at certain times of the 
year. He did the math involved and created a spreadsheet of numbers explaining his results. This graphic visualizes the 
motion of an 11 by 11 array of mirrors throughout a solar year. The declination of the sun changes +/- 23.5 degrees 
with the seasons. The change of the focus can be adjusted depending on the energy requirements of the solar thermal 
application from steam heat to electricity to chemical processing. </p>
