<ul>
    <li>Visualization deals with the idea of trasforming data
        into images that accurately represent the information
        about the data. Therefore the two main goals of
        Visualization are <i>Transformation</i> and <i>Representation</i>.
        <ol>
            <li>Transformation deals with converting the data
                from its original form into graphics primitives.</li>
            <li>Representation deals with the internal
                representation of the data and the graphics
                primitives generated to depict the data.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>We next need to define things in terms of a functional
        model and an object model.
        <ul>
            <li>The functional model defines how data flows
                through the system.</li>
            <li>The object model describes which modules operate
                on the data.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>There are two choices for combinining the functional
        model into an object model
        <ul>
            <li>The first choice is to combine process and data
                objects. This binds the data and methods into one
                object. This is good in that the processes, which
                are data manipulation algorithms, have direct
                access to the data which makes for fast code. The
                drawbacks are:
                <ol>
                    <li>Users generally think of data algorithms
                        as separate objects, for instance a user
                        may want to generate contours of a data
                        set. If the process is separate from the
                        data we can use on gerenal contour
                        process object to operate on many
                        different types of data objects. </li>
                    <li>If we bind processes to data objects,
                        algorithms must be implemented in all
                        objects of any data type we may create.
                        Also if we change our contouring
                        algorithm this must be changed in each
                        data object the implements thsi process.</li>
                    <li>Binding the data and processes also make
                        for complex data dependant code and
                        simple objects now become large and
                        complex.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Visualization pipeline consists of objects to
        represent data (data objects), objects to operate on data
        (process objects), and an indicated direction of data
        flow.</li>
    <li>The elements of the pipeline can obviously be linked in a
        variety of ways to create visualization networks. In this
        model the two issues to be aware of are <i>type</i> and <i>multiplicity</i>.
        <ul>
            <li>Type refers to the form the data process objects
                either accept or supply. A contour object may
                want a data set of connected points and then
                output a container object that holds graphics
                primitives.</li>
            <li>Multiplicity deals with the number of input and
                output objects allowed for any one process
                object.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>To be useful a visualization network needs to process
        data to generate a desired result. The complete process
        of making each process object to operate is called the <i>execution</i>
        of the network. We must ensure that all process objects
        execute in the defined order and only if they need to.
        This is important because we only want those objects to
        execute that have had their input modified. We need to
        define a method by which we can oversee the execution of
        the network.</li>
    <li>There are two methods for this: <i>Explicit</i> and <i>Implicit</i>
        control.
        <ul>
            <li>Explicit control directly tracks the execution of
                the network and records changes and then directly
                controls the the execution of the process
                objects. This method must track all objects and
                changes to any one object in order to renotify
                any dependant objects that a change has occured.
                The nice aspect of this is that there is a single
                process which tracks the network, this allows us
                to gather execution information for data flow
                graphs. The drawbacks are each process is
                dependant on the executive object and must notify
                it of any internal changes. Also the executive
                cannot easily control execution if the network
                execution is conditional since to execute or not
                is dependant on one or more other objects.</li>
            <li>Implicit control means a process object executes
                only if the local data or input changes. Implicit
                control is implemented using a two pass method. 
                <ul>
                    <li>The first pass deals with a recursive
                        traversal of objects until the source
                        object is found, this is the <i>update</i>
                        pass. The source object then executes if
                        necessary and the path is reversed until
                        the requesting object is encountered and
                        the sequence terminates. This is refered
                        to as the <i>execution</i> pass. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Another aspect of visualization networks is <i>conditional
        execution</i>, we may want data to map through different
        lookup tables based on some criterion.</li>
    <li>A sound memory model is very important, we want to
        minimize the amount of new data generated and maximize
        the availabilty of data throughout the network.</li>
    <li>A method of minimizing the memory requirements is to
        implement reference counting, this allows more than one
        object to share data stores.</li>
    <li>Visualization systems must be easy to use and designed
        for human interaction.</li>
