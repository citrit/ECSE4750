	* Moved test classes to test/ and changed names.

	* Added JoglRenderer to clean up tests, and give a glutish
	feel to our stuff. 

	* Overhauled native code to get rid of stuff we don't
	need anymore.

	* Added NEED_OWN_WINDOW to config.h stuff so that we
	can tell when we're on SGI's and create our own window
	that's a subwindow of the canvas.

	* Added sun/awt/motif/X11pDataAccess to get canvas window id.
	Added jogl/JoglpDataAccess interface that the above implements
	to get the code in JoglCanvas platform independent.

	* Added a test target to compile the test classes.

	* Added directories doc and demo soon to be full of relevant
	material.

	* Made JoglWidget implement ComponentListener so it can keep
	up with the JoglFrame's geometry changes.  Some bug fixes in 
	OpenGL_open.c.

	* Incorporated Adam's implementation of the list stuff.

	* Rewrote openJoglWidget so that it worked with SGI's.

	* Overhauled lib code to use JNI.  Found a bunch of bugs
	in OpenGL_funcs.c.  Optimized many functions.  Regular
	usage (with parameter checking) can be had by defining DEBUG.
