<P>
These tutorial notes were last updated in late July 1998.
As of this date,
the most current version of Java 3D is <I>version 1.1 beta 1</I>,
the first beta release after three public alpha releases.
This release of Java 3D is dependent upon sound, image, and font
features found in JDK 1.2, whose most current release as of July
is <I>version 1.2 beta 3</I>!
<P>
The good news is that Java 3D and JDK 1.2 are leading-edge technologies
and represent the forefront of 3D application development technology.
The bad news is that these tutorial notes are based upon <I>beta</I>
releases, and as such are as unstable as those early
software releases.
<p>
As with all beta product releases, functionality in
both Java 3D and the JDK is not yet complete or fully stable.
This is natural and appropriate for early releases.
The impact on these tutorial notes is that some Java 3D features
could not be adequately discussed or example applications generated.
For instance, the beta 1 Java 3D release is missing stable
support for:
<P>
<DL>
	<DD><LI>Compressed geometry
	<DD><LI>3D text geometry and fonts
	<DD><LI>Texture images with alpha channels
	<DD><LI>Some behavior wakeup conditions
	<DD><LI>Full OBJ file loading
	<DD><LI>Background geometry
	<DD><LI>MIDI sound files
	<DD><LI>Cone sounds
	<DD><LI>Sound localization, reverb, and doppler shift
</DL>
<P>
Some JDK 1.2 features do not mesh well with Java 3D
as of the JDK beta 3 release, including support for:
<P>
<DL>
	<DD><LI>Mixing swing lightweight and Java 3D components
	<DD><LI>Mixing Java Media Framework classes and Java 3D sound classes
	<DD><LI>Reading image files other than GIF and JPEG
</DL>
<P>
It is inevitable that some Java 3D or JDK 1.2 features
will change between July 1998 and the final release of these APIs.
This may cause some of the example applications in these notes to
fail to compile or execute properly with the final APIs.
Wherever possible, we have avoided use of features we felt were unstable
and likely to change.  This should enhance the chance that the
early examples included here will work with the final release of
Java 3D and JDK 1.2.

As we near the final release of Java 3D and JDK 1.2, expected to be
late in 1998, we will will continue to evolve these tutorial notes,
updating examples and slide coverage.
