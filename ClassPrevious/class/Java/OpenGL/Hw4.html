<H2 align=center>&nbsp;Home Work 4</H2>
<P align=center><B>Due: Midnight on Tues March 27, 2001</B></P>
<P>This homework involves creating an animation from the supplied files. Use 
your version of the rendering system so far so you can test your 
implementations. This will really benefit from a good display list 
implementation so I suggest you make sure yours is working.</P>
<P>You assignment is to create a scene using your rendering system that has 
these things:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>
  <DIV>A plane that represents the ground, preferably with a texture map making 
  it look like it actually is ground. I am sure you can find&nbsp; picture of 
  dirt somewhere. The Texture object uses the Java image handler so the texture 
  can be any image you can find. Have fun and be creative.</DIV></LI>
  <LI>
  <DIV>Create an Action object that controls the x29 that is supplied in the 
  Anim.zip file to make it fly around the scene. Again be creative and have 
  fun.</DIV></LI>
  <LI>
  <DIV>Create an Action to move the cow around the scene. Extra credit for 
  texturing the Gateway Cow patches on this heffer.</DIV></LI>
  <LI>
  <DIV>Create an Action to have the Teapot jiggle likes it boiling 
  over.</DIV></LI></OL>
<P>As you can see there is a lot going on during this little animation. There 
are many ways to optimize this scene to make things happen at a respectable 
frame rate. Make sure you investigate these and do your best to have good frame 
rates.</P>
<P>You do not have to include the STL files of the cow, plane, and teapot in 
your submission. It will just slow down the email servers.</P>
