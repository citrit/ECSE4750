<h2><a name="04"></a>Final Exam</h2>

<p>The Computer Graphics final exam is in class on Thursday.  It is 25%
of the final grade.  You may bring two 2-sided, 8.5 by 11 inch, crib
sheets, calculators, food, etc.  After the exams are graded, you may
examine your exam, but not keep it.

<h1><a name="08"></a>Rendering, Ctd</h1>

<h2><a name="09"></a>Rendering Pipeline -  More Detail</h2>

<p>This updates class 37.</p>


<ol>

<li><p>Your object's surface is probably a curved patch, such as a bicubic
parametric patch.  u and v are 2 parameters, and range from 0 to 1.
a, b, and c are 48 coefficients defining the patch.
</p></li>

<p><center>
x = sum for both i,j from 0 to 3 of a<sub>ij</sub> u<sup>i</sup>v<sup>j</sup><br>
y = sum for both i,j from 0 to 3 of b<sub>ij</sub> u<sup>i</sup>v<sup>j</sup><br>
z = sum for both i,j from 0 to 3 of c<sub>ij</sub> u<sup>i</sup>v<sup>j</sup><br>
</center>
</p>


<li><p>Why cubic?  It's the lowest degree that allows adjacent patches
to be created whose second derivatives match at the join.  That means
that the join is generally invisible.  I.e., you don't want to look at
a new car and see where the body was divided into patches by the
designer.  </p></li>

<li><p>Alternatively, a conic section (aka quadric surface) is
sometimes used.</p></li>

<li><p>A torus (donut) might also be used; it's a quartic curve.</p></li>

<li><p>You need a lighting equation that takes:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the direction to the light source,</p></li>

<li><p>the normal to the surface, and</p></li>

<li><p>the direction to the viewer,</p></li>
</ol>

<p>and gives the intensity at a point.</p>

<li><p>Different surfaces have different lighting equations.  A <em>flat
(Lambertian)</em> surface, like a carpet, reflects light out equally
in all directions.</p></li>

<li><p>A <em>specular (mirror)</em> surface reflects light out only in
one direction, at the angle of reflection.</p></li>

<li><p>Most surfaces reflect more light, but not all, at the angle of
reflection.</p></li>

<li><p>Since the lighting equation, and its inputs, especially the surface normal, are expensive to calculate, approximations are common.</p></li>


<li><p>You can calculate the normal to the bicubic patch at any point.  Take
the partial derivatives in two directions, find their cross-product,
and normalize the result.  However, that's probably too slow, so we
approximate.
</p></li>

<li><p>Often we divide the surface into flat patches or facets, and
shade each patch separately.  </p></li>

<li><p>The fastest way is flat shading, where the whole patch is the same
intensity.   However, the boundaries between the patches will be
obnoxious, because the Mach band effect amplifies sudden intensity
changes.
</p></li>

<li><p>Gouraud shading is the next better, and slower method.  Calculate the
normal to the surface at each corner of the patch.  Use that to
calculate the intensities at the corners.  Linearly interpolate the
intensity at each interior point.
</p>

<p>One problem is that Gouraud shading will never generate a highlight
inside a patch.
</p>

<li><p>The next better, and slower, method is Phong shading.  Here, we take
the normals at the 4 corners, and interpolate an approximate normal at
each interior point.  We have to normalize each interpolated normal
(make its length to be one.)  Then we input that into the lighting
equation to find each point's intensity.
</p></li>

<li><p>It's not enough that each separate image we shade look good.  If we're
generating a video sequence, then the shading has to be consistent
from frame to frame.
</p></li>

</ol>



<h2><a name="10"></a>Ray Tracing Notes</h2>


<ol>

<li><p>Fire a ray from the center of projection (aka viewpoint) thru
each pixel until it hits some object.</p></li>

<li><p>If that object is shiny, continue tracing the reflected
ray.</p></li>


<li><p>If that object is partly transparant, continue tracing two
rays: the transmitted (refracted) and the reflected, and combine the
results.</p></li>

<li><p>Snell's law gives the angle of the refracted ray.</p></li>


<li><p>Fresnell's law gives the proportion of the input ray that is
reflected.</p></li>

<li><p>These laws may be derived from Maxwell's equations.</p></li>

<li><p>A separate problem is to determine the objects' brightness.
Perhaps raytrace from the light sources to do this.</p></li>


<li><p>Strengths: Shiny, transparent, glassy, objects.</p></li>


<li><p>Weaknesses: Diffuse shadows, Antialiasing.</p></li>


<li><p>If an object's projection is as small as a pixel, then whether
one ray or no rays hit it is random.</p></li>


<li><p>This causes a speckling in the image.</p></li>


<li><p>This is worse in a video since each frame is speckled
independently.  The result might look like a noisy TV
channel.</p></li>


<li><p>Reflection from convex mirrors may cause even large objects to
appear small, and to suffer from this problem.</p></li>


<li><p>One solution is to use more, smaller, pixels.</p></li>


<li><p>A more sophisticated solution is to subdivide only critical
pixels into about 16 subpixels, and combine the result.</p></li>


<li><p>A critical pixel might be one whose color is quite different
from its neighbors.</p></li>


<li><p>Another method is stochastic ray tracing.</p></li>


<li><p>Instead of firing a ray thru the center of each pixel, fire it
thru a random point in the pixel (considering the pixel as a square).
This is not as good as subpixel averaging, but is faster.  It also has
problems with a video sequence.</p></li>

</ol>


<h2><a name="11"></a>Radiosity</h2>


<ol>

<li><p>Radiosity calculates diffuse shadows well.</p></li>


<li><p>Divide the scene into patches.</p></li>


<li><p>Compute how much of the light emitted from any particular patch
hits each other patch (the form factors).</p></li>


<li><p>The light arriving at particular patch is the sum of the light
leaving each other patch times the form factor for the pair of that
patch and this patch.</p></li>


<li><p>The light leaving this patch is any light it emits (if it's a
light source) plus its reflectivity times the light arriving.</p></li>


<li><p>This assumes perfect diffuse reflection.</p></li>


<li><p>Knowing the form factors and emitted light, solve for each
patch's brightness.</p></li>


<li><p>Having the patches' sizes quadruples the number of patches,
increases the number of form factors by 16, and increases the solution
time by 64.</p></li>


<li><p>Hierarchical patches, like quadtrees, can speed this
up.</p></li>


<li><p>None of this uses the observer's location. </p></li>


<li><p>You can preprocess a scene with radiosity, then walk thru it in
real time.</p></li>


</ol>

<h2><a name="12"></a>Final Touches</h2>

<ol>

<li><p>Combine ray tracing, radiosity, bump mapping, texture mapping, etc,
etc.</p></li>

<li><p>Bump mapping perturbs surface normals to simulate
micro-texture.  The perturbed normals cause lighting
perturbations.</p></li>

<li><p>Texture mapping paints a 2-D image onto the surface.  The image must
be appropriately transformed.</p></li>

<li><p>3-D texture mapping models solids like wood and marble.</p></li>

<li><p>For an example of a current PC graphics board, the Creative 3D
Blaster Annihilator using the GeForce 256 chipset, which paints 480M
pixels/sec, see <a
href="http://www.cnn.com/1999/TECH/computing/12/06/annihilator.review/index.html">CNN</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Finally, read the proposed SIGGRAPH programs released on 1
April 91 and 1 April 92, <a href="siggraph9192">here</a>.  If you can
understand the references, then you know some graphics.</p></li>

<h1><a name="13"></a>News on the Web</h1>

<h2><a name="14"></a>IBM supercomputer</h2>

<p>IBM plans to build a 1M processor petaflops (10<sup>15</sup> flops)
machine for $100M, during the next few years.  An SGI spokesman said
that that was impossible.  See <a
href="http://www.cnn.com/1999/TECH/computing/12/07/big.blue.gene/index.html">CNN</a>.
The organization is 64 racks of 8 boards each of 64 chips each with 32
processors each.  </p>

<h2><a name="15"></a>IBM Fast Chips</h2>

<p>IBM says they can build a 90GHz chip, up at Burlington VT.  See
