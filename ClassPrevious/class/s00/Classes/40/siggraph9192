TUTORIALS 
=============================================

Tutorial : The Monte Carlo Method as a Way of Avoiding Math
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tutorial : Careers in Computer Graphics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Participants will learn about opportunities in the graphics industry and 
will be introduced to conversational Japanese.

Tutorial : Successful Grant Procurement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Director of the Cornell Buzzword Concatenator Project
presents his method of proposal writing and discusses in detail
his highly successful 1990 NSF-funded project, "Parallel Neural
Networks for the Physically-Based Adaptive Subdivision of NURBS
in Multidimensional Ray-Traced Radiosity of a Virtual Reality
Visualization".

Tutorial: Introduction to Computer Graphics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Participants will learn that "radiosity" means to lighten up the 
pastel-colored things that are dark and that "teleological modeling in a 
classical Newtonian regime" means to connect the parts with springs.

Tutorial: Landscaping for Real-Time Graphics Companies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Computer graphics has struggled to model objects with
photographic realism.  In the case of manufactured objects, the
solution has been to force all manufacturers to use CAD/CAM so
that the man-made environment consists of simple geometries.  A
modification of this solution can be applied to the natural
environment.  We will discuss how to prune evergreens into cones
and how to shape shrubs into spheres and rectilinear hedges.
Landscaping your company's property using these techniques will
allow your simplistic models of nature to match exactly the view
outside the window, fooling visiting customers.

PANELS
=============================================

Panel : Graphics Hardware Standards 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	The panelists will address the surge of interest in
standard, interchangeable graphics components.  Such standards
are of topical importance because, as graphics manufacturers go
out of business, it would be convenient if their products could
be disassembled and plugged directly into Silicon Graphics
products.

Panel : Raster Image File Format Standards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chairman : N. AfricanAmericanPonte, MIT Media Lab

Panelists:
M.W. Mantle, Pixar 
	"We should be happy to live in a country with so many raster image 
	standards to choose from."

S. Thomas, Univ. of Michigan
	"I don't know which universal image standard everyone is going to
	use, but I know which one I'm going to use."

A. Warhol, independent
	"In the future, everyone will design an image format that
	will be the industry standard for fifteen minutes."

EXTENDED ABSTRACTS OF SELECTED TECHNICAL PAPERS
=============================================

Paper : Subpixel Rendering of Bicubic Patches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Third-order patches have been rendered by subdividing
them into second-order patches, first-order polygonal surfaces
(Lane-Carpenter), and zero-order pixel-sized surfaces (Catmull).
We suggest continuing the subdivision until the subpatch is the
size of a molecule, where it can be rendered by a standard
molecular modeling package.
	Molecules have advantages also in creating realistic
models.  In the same way that Euler operations guarantee that a
model is topologically realizable, modeling with molecular
primitives guaranteed that a model could be manufactured with
real molecules.  To verify the modeler, we invoke the Weierstrass
theorem, which states that any object can be made from any
primitive if you use alot of them.  We implemented uncharged
atoms in C, ions in C++.

Paper : Laser Beam Tracing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Ray tracing is slow, which is ironic since the rays are
supposedly traveling at the speed of light.  Most of the time is
spent in the ray-surface intersection.  The authors feel that,
having done all the work of intersecting with a surface, the ray
should do more when it gets there.  Laser rays provide the energy
for this work.
	Instead of antialiasing the image, the ray locally melts
the surface colors, blurring them.  Likewise, when a laser ray
hits a polygonal object, the sharp angles are eroded away to
create a smooth surface.
	If the force of rays is varied, then bumpy surfaces are
realized.  Translucency occurs when some rays are strong enough
to blow right through the surface.  Likewise, penumbra is
accomplished when some rays blast through objects while
proceeding to the light source.
 
Paper : Scaling Properties of Patents on Fractals  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	The author has patented "fractal" functions for the
creation of synthetic images.  A fractal exhibits statistical
"self-similarity", wherein the function reveals the same
statistical composition regardless of the scale at which it is
considered.  Thus, the author's patent applies at all possible
scales.
	Fractals can be characterized by their "fractional
dimension", which is intuitively a measure of their roughness.
Since changing the fractional dimension of a fractal creates a
new fractal, the author's patent extends to fractals of any
roughness.  A fractal surface of zero roughness is a smooth
surface, so the author's patent subsumes all smooth surface
methods in computer graphics.
	While fractals describe the smooth surfaces of man-made
objects, they also describe the irregular, intricate objects of
the natural world, and thus fall under the author's patent.  Even
if nature was not composed of fractals, the retinal veins in
front of the rods and cones are fractal, so nature would look
fractal anyway.  Fortunately for the author, nature really is
fractal.
	The geometry of galaxies can also be described by
fractals.  Thus, all natural and man-made objects are fractal
when considered at a very large scale.  Thus, because the
author's patent exhibits scaling, it applies to all natural and
man-made objects.
	Due to self-similarity, fractals exhibit small variations
over small distances and large variations over large distances.
Since length, width, and height can only change by small amounts
over small distances but can change by large amounts over large
distances, space itself is fractal and thus is covered by the
author's patent.

Paper : 
Calculating Light Intensities in the Presence of a Participating Medium
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During a seance, the participating medium draws forth the ghost
of Omnibus Graphics.  We present a method of simulating the
scattering/absorption of the resulting apparition density.

Paper : The Fast Furrier Transform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	We introduce a method of rendering furry surfaces, and
present results of our experiments in producing a synthetic furry
teddy bear.
	In the same way a furrier strips the hide off an animal
and wraps it around a blue-haired woman, we stripped the hide off
a koala bear and digitized it so it could be mapped onto a
synthetic bear model.  To obtain the 3D geometry of the teddy
bear, we sliced the nude koala bear into serial sections, which
were digitized.  It is interesting to note that "rendering" can
also mean "dismembering and grinding up".

Paper : The Application of Computer Graphics to Hardcore Pornography
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Contrary to the ambient opinion that computer animation
has no applicability, we suggest it is well-suited to
pornography.  It is true that porn requires accurate rendering of
the human form.  However, once generic male and female forms are
created, all other forms are of the same topology.  Porno stars
generally differ from generic forms only by excessive local
scaling factors.  Also, while the facial expressions of the
actors need to be duplicated, the acting ability of today's stars
suggests that "male concentration" and "female boredom" would be
a sufficient vocabulary of expressions.  Furthermore, the
difficult problems of rendering clothing and lip-synching
dialogue are avoided.  The actors' surfaces are emissive,
transmissive, submissive, and permissive.
	Porn is well-suited to computer animation techniques
because most of the action is rhythmic and periodic, requiring
the rendering of only one cycle.  Any dynamics that cannot be
resolved procedurally might be addressed by the VPL DataCondom.
	In advanced pornographical animations systems,
constraint-based optimization will properly assemble large orgies
such that each character plugs into his/her topological
complement.  The system will plug together a gay male and lesbian
female by introducing a hermaphrodite as an adapter.
	Until realistic human bodies are perfected, current
synthetic characters could succeed in porn via such vehicles as
"Bogie and Marilyn Do It French(-Canadian) Style", "Sexy Robot
Straightens Wally B's Stinger", and "Behind Closed Doors: What
You Never Knew About the Luxo Family".

Paper : Solutions for Unemployment in Graphics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	In 1974, Sutherland, et al. presented "A Characterization
of Ten Hidden-Surface Algorithms", which revealed how such
algorithms could be unified as types of spatial sorting.  Today's
research solves the hidden-surface problem with ray tracing,
which was not one of the ten algorithms.  Clearly, ten
researchers are out of work.
	It is difficult for any laborer when he is replaced by a
computer.  Supercomputers and special-purpose hardware have
replaced the hidden-surface researchers, and the result is grim.
Gary Watkins and Robert Schumacker are stuck in management
positions.  John Warnock, while not being forced to live in Utah,
has been reduced to typesetting.
	One of the ten unemployed researchers was the inventor of
the depth buffer.  Fortunately, in 1986 he was pushed again to
the forefront of research when the depth buffer was used to
render the facets of hemi-cubes as part of the view-independent
radiosity computation.  The method works for static scenes such
as graphics programmers waiting for a radiosity method to finish.
	For the other hidden-surface researchers, graphics has
now developed a severance plan in the form of the ZZBuffer.  The
ZZBuffer speeds up ray tracing by spatially sorting all objects
with respect to an eyepoint.  Thus, ZZBuffer creation can be
improved by using the ten hidden surface algorithms, giving ten
researchers a new lease on life.

Advancements in Cheating for the Animation of Synthetic Faces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	We present a new device for tracking facial shape and motion
so that you can use the data to animate a face model despite your
lack of actual physiological understanding.
	The first person to steal geometry from a real face in order
to make a synthetic face was H. Gouraud.  (Gouraud and his
University of Utah colleagues B.T. Phong and J.W. Flat are renowned
for inventing the shading methods that bear their names.)  Gouraud
convinced his wife to have a grid drawn on her face so she could be
digitized.  Unfortunately, in his zeal Gouraud had the grid tattooed
on instead.  Mrs. Gouraud won her husband's VW in the ensuing
divorce, and she went on to marry a Zulu prince who fancied her
makeup.
	Two decades later, researchers are still painting geometric
landmarks on innocent people's faces.  Some researchers have sought
out persons with measles or severe acne from which to
photogrammetrically derive geometry, but the concept is the same.
One researcher wanted to create facial animations by interpolating
between CAT scans of specific facial expressions.  It's still
cheating.
	We present a new product for cheating: The VPL DataBurnoose.
The burnoose is a nylon stocking worn over the head.  The stocking
is lined with the same fiber optic measurement technology used in
the tiny datasuits employed by David Zeltzer in his animations of
cockroaches.  The device has a special multisensor pouch in which
the tongue is put.  The burnoose adheres to the face tightly enough
that eye motion can be tracked.

Retrospective : Flying Logos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	In the movie "2001 : A Space Odyssey", an ape, touched by
intelligence, finds a femur that looks like an upper-case "I".  In a
moment of ecstatic rage he throws the bone in the air, realizing
mankind's first flying letter.  Since then, man has sought to make
his words fly.  Ancient hieroglyphic symbols are often in the shapes
of eagles and hawks.  From the paper airplane to aerodynamic sans
serif fonts, mankind has been driven to make his words fly.
	Today we enter a new age of alphabet flight with the Logo
Butterfly, which boasts 26 special-purpose processors, keeping
mankind safe from the age-old fear of name dropping.

GENERAL INFORMATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	The multiple ribbons formerly worn below the name tag will
now hang down from the crotch so as to better serve as indicators of
social hierarchy within the herd.

Subject: Siggraph '92 Preliminary Program
Date: 1 Apr 92 05:34:22 GMT

	The Siggraph `92 Conference On Computer Graphics and
Interactive Techniques will be held July 27 - 31 in Chicago,
Illinois.  The following contains selected portions of the Siggraph
'92 Preliminary Program :

COMPUTER GRAPHICS ACHIEVEMENT AWARD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	
	Presented to persons who have significantly influenced the
progress of the computer graphics industry.

This Year's Winner : Elle Macpherson

	Ms. Macpherson accounts for 97% of all GIF image files
transmitted among computing professionals, insuring that GIF will
become the standard for network image interchange.

KEYNOTE ADDRESS 
===========================================================

"State-of-the-Art in Anal-Retentive Illumination Models" by Don Greenberg.

	Dr. Greenberg will review illumination models that for two
decades have maintained the Law of Constant Rendering Time, which
states that the time needed to render a high-quality image shall be
one full day, regardless of the speed of the hardware.
	Just a few years ago, ray tracing a surface would take all
day.  However, that is no longer true, and so more complex
illumination models are needed.  According to the new treatise by
Greenberg, Torrance, Sparrow, and Cook entitled "Wait, It's Not That
Simple", current research considers each diffusely reflecting
surface patch to be an irregular assembly of microfacets.  The
microfacets must be ray traced to get reflection coefficients.  If
this doesn't take long enough, then each microfacet itself can be
considered as an assembly of smaller facets.  This
subdivide-and-publish paradigm should insure that illumination
methods will defeat the hardware for years to come.

TUTORIALS
=====================================================

Fundamentals Seminar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Again in 1992, Siggraph will host a Sunday seminar for those
who are forced to stay over Saturday night to qualify for the
excursion fare.  Attendees will learn the basics of computer
graphics, including the so-called "paint" packages, and digital
"windows" with the capability to "cut" images and "paste" them
elsewhere.  We will also consider the "viewing" through a synthetic
"camera" of "surfaces" positioned in "space" and "illuminated" by
ersatz "lightsources".  As lecturer Edwin "Ed" Catmull notes, "To
paraphrase Milton, 'Our ''reality'', like ''beauty'', is in the
virtual ''eye'' of the proverbial ''beholder'''".

Basic Algorithms Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Attendees will learn how to prove the optimality of their
algorithms, so that when their algorithm produces lousy results they
can at least claim that no one else can do better.

Applications of Planar Fractals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Julia and Mandelbrot sets, originally thought to have no
application at all, have displaced Blinn's Blobby Lava Lamp as the
Mac screensaver of choice among the new age Silicon Valley heads.
However, the Vivarium project, a simulated ecosystem whose purpose
has baffled experts, is poised to overcome fractals as the
screensaver of the 21st century.
	Marijuana cigarettes will not be available as the call for
papers was not issued in time.

State-of-the-Art in Naming Those Sombrero-Shaped Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	The names "Laterally-Inhibiting Receptive Field", "Windowed
Sinc Function", "Laplacian", "Cardinal Spline", "Gabor Function",
and "Difference-of-Gaussian" are being superceded by "Wavelet".

Solving Graphics Problems with Wide-Area Networks 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	When faced with a graphics problem, e.g. how to calculate
the distance between a point and a line, degree-seeking students
find it easiest to ask for the answer on a graphics-related InterNet
newsgroup.  Attendees will learn how to post their questions so they
don't sound like homework problems.  We will also learn why we get
rude responses when we ask for a public-domain package for
intersecting two lines, or when we ask for a C procedure that
converts a photograph into a CAD database.

ABSTRACTS OF SELECTED TECHNICAL PAPERS
======================================================

Generalized Condoms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Although typically used for surfacing cylindrical models,
the membrane and thin plate terms of the condom allow arbitrary
deformations of the surface without tearing.  Furthermore, one size
fits all models.  Thus, like convolutional surfaces and global
splines, the condom can be used to skin highly-articulated skeletal
armatures.
	Color, texture, and bump mapping are discussed.  A top-down,
scanline approach to rolling the surface over the armature is
presented.

Auropresence
~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Our research team at AT&T has designed and deployed into
every home in the nation a communications network that provides
real-time, two-way audio virtual reality, or "auropresence".
Experiments show that cybernauts, using unobtrusive hand-held
headsets, interact verbally with remote users as if all parties were
in the same room.

Graphics Hardware Acceleration for Hierarchical Splatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	We discuss how to impose a hierarchy of point-spread
functions when rendering volume visualizations using arrays of
Stardent graphics supercomputers.  Our method is based on the
observation that, the higher the window that the Stardent is thrown
out of, the more time the graphics hardware can accelerate and thus
the larger the splat upon the concrete.

The Oz-slow Algorithm for Vector Field Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Weightless streamlining witches, cows, and loved ones are
advected into the flow field and observed from the door of the
viewing house, a spinning framework that itself follows path
integrals through the dataset.  Data can be sent somewhere over the
rainbow colormap, where it will be rendered in technicolor.

Image Processing within a PostScript Interpreter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	PostScript interpreters tuned to process text often have
access to thousands of bitmapped fonts.  We suggest that such
interpreters can also succeed in processing gray-tone images by
converting the images into arrays of characters.
	Scaling an image can be performed simply by changing the
font's point size.  Contrast is enhanced by changing to a bold font.
Rotation is implemented by using italic fonts; repeatedly
italicizing horizontally and then vertically will accomplish the
Catmull-Smith two-pass image rotation algorithm.
	With enough fonts, a given font will be assured that all its
affine transformations are simply other existing fonts.  Thus,
according to the Collage theorem, Iterated Function Systems can be
used to encode images given a single letter from any font.  This
will work especially well for encoding images of text.

Digital Simulation of a Painter's Materials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	We present a digital paint system which simulates the
surface behavior and dynamics of time-tested painting implements.
The system manages the video display so that it exhibits the
irregular structure of a cave wall, and the system allows the user
to choose colors from a pallete of crushed berries and animal
organs.  PostScript output onto a real cave is discussed.

Ethical Considerations in Graphics Production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	In 1989, researchers at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign were applauded for their "Study of a Numerically
Modeled Severe Storm", a dynamic visualization of data derived from
the simulation of a synthetic tornado.  However, it has been
recently revealed that their data was not fake, but was in fact
real.  We discuss the fallout of the ensuing scandal.

Memory Technologies for Direct Volume Visualization 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	We at the Computer Museum in Boston just realized that our
museum is filled with junk.  You think you're clever, unloading your
computer garbage on us like we were Jersey.  Well, forget about
history.  From now on we're doing volume visualization, on the
leading edge.
	In volume visualization, the task is to render the data so
that it appears to have a 3D physical form.  However, this task can
be avoided if the data is held in a memory device that itself has a
3D physical form.  In addition to its volumetric shape, the memory
components must be large enough to be visible to the naked eye.  The
only memories that fulfill these constraints are the ferrite core
memories of the 60's.  Binary voxel arrays can be loaded into core
memories that have been coated with magnetically reactive pigment so
that each core is white or black.  In this way, a researcher can
comprehend his 3D data by walking around and peeking inside the
memory itself.  And the memory is free; in fact, we'll pay you to
move it out of here.

MacKoax! from Coax Inc.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	We present a product that is plug-compatible with Mac's,
PC's, Unix workstations, and all other SCSI, parallel, or custom
ports.  The device operates at room temperature and does not require
power.  Its simple design provides ISDN, TCP/IP,
big-endian/little-endian functionality that accepts PostScript,
NTSC, voice, IGES, MIDI, Group 3, and all other formats, under the
condition that input and output formats are the same.  The device
works at video rates and, because it doesn't do anything, it
operates without any data loss or distortion.

CAT Scan Visualization in PostScript
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	We present a new method of using PostScript to visualize
objects formed from serial sections.  Our method begins by
thresholding the volume data into a 3D bitmap of voxels that are
either transparent or opaque.  We then iterate over all 2D sections,
converting each into a PostScript bitmap.  We then send the bitmaps
to our laser printer, which we have enhanced so that the laser
actually burns the paper away at the positions of transparent
pixels.  As sections are printed off, they form a stack in the
output tray.  Eventually, the CAT scan data volume is realized in
solid paper, which can be bound in book form.

Physics and the Mootness of Graphics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Current trends in photorealistic graphics involve
thermodynamics for radiosity calculation, optics for ray tracing,
classical mechanics for physically-based animation, and Kirchoff's
laws for reflection and absorption.  Thus, an undergraduate physics
curriculum that uses computer simulations will accidentally
recapitulate all of computer graphics while resulting in a kick-ass
renderer.

FILM & VIDEO SHOW
==========================================================

	The Up With People chorus will give a live multimedia
rendition of "Chicago : It's Not as Bad as Detroit".  Unfortunately,
our usual laser show has been hired away by the International
PostScript Convention.  However, we do have a flatbed plotter whose
pens have been replaced with lasers.  PostScript path files
submitted to the plotter will be drawn calligraphically on the
projection screen.

PDI Morph Reel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	For a recent Michael Jackson music video, Pacific Data
Images created what is to date the longest continuous raster image
morph sequence, involving transitions between more than a dozen
completely different human faces.  Each face was Michael Jackson
after a plastic surgical operation.  Digital extrapolation was used
to predict Jackson's future appearance as he achieves his goal of a
"Siamese-Cat-with-Kirk-Douglas-Chin" look.

Excerpts from "Terminator 2"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	In the future, blobby models (metaballs, equipotential
isosurfaces) will enjoy continued success over competing surface
methods.  All other modeling technologies will be made obsolete
while blobby models will become a world-wide standard.  Eventually,
Blobbies will decide they don't need the humans.  Shiny,
environment-mapped deformable pseudopods will go on a rampage and
nearly terminate the human race.
	In "Terminator 2", a Blobby travels back in time in order to
terminate a boy named Pierre Bezier, the only person who can stop
blobby modeling from taking over.  The Blobby terminator's ability
to distend his shiny metallic anatomy to any length lets him become
a successful porno star named Long Dong Silver.

The Making of "Starwatcher"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	For the feature film "Starwatcher", new techniques in the
modeling of totally synthetic scenes have been perfected.  A
Cyberware scanner is used to digitize real faces in a variety of
facial expressions while mouthing all possible phonemes.  The Data
Suit is worn by live actors and domesticated animals to capture
natural-looking action.  Textures and scenery are derived from sonar
and optical recordings taken on-location.  Clay models are moved
incrementally and then laser digitized to create a different 3D
object to be rendered for each frame.  By combining these
techniques, "Starwatcher" will become the first feature length film
in the history of cinema that is entirely computer-animated,
completely untouched by human hands, involving no live action
footage at all.

Special Effects in the Next "Star Trek"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	In motion pictures (such as Lawnmower Man, Looker, Return of
the Jedi, and the genesis effect in Star Trek 2), computer graphics
effects have been used quite successfully to depict, um, computer
graphics.  Now, the artifacts of computer graphics will be used to
best advantage in "Star Trek NaN : The Wrath of Phong"....

< The landing party alpha-blends to opacity on the planet's surface. >

SPOCK : The tricorder indicates a complete lack of mirror
	reflections and cast shadows.  Also, if we travel too far
	from the origin, we will suffer from round-off error.
	Captain, this planet is highly dangerous; it was wise to
	bring expendable red-shirted security men.

< An expendable red-shirted security man turns to the side while looking  
  upward.  His neck joint suffers gimbal lock, and he falls in a heap.  The 
  group rushes to him. >

MCCOY : Jim, he's dead.

KIRK : < throws arms wide, ripping shirt >  No quaternions?  What kind of
	planet is this?

< An omnipotent, dim-witted native of the planet approaches, walking
  through cone-shaped trees and icosahedral boulders.  His form is
  that of a matte gray desk lamp.  For no apparent reason, his light
  bulb flashes when he speaks. >

LAMP : Why does this death cause such grief, One-They-Call-Kirk?
	Was he not a non-speaking extra?

KIRK : He was just an extra, yes, but still an actor, and, so, we, actors, 
	all of us, too, feel his pain, his agony.  Regardless of age or 
	experience, each of my species belongs to a single screen actor's 
	guild.

< Another native of the planet, a curvaceous astro-bimbette, enters. >

ASTRO-BIMBETTE : When you open your mouth wide while over-acting, I
	can't see out the back of your head.  You are not from here,
	are you?

KIRK : We are from a far-away planet.  And yet, like your sun, ours
	is a point light source at infinity.  We will return there
	soon.

A-B :  Why must you leave?  Does my form not please you?

KIRK : Oh, yes.  Your complexion is very uniform, your surfaces are
	subdivided to a pleasant smoothness, and your boundary
	representation implies that your head is empty.  My gender
	finds these traits attractive.  Though I'm sure your not
	just a Kirk-tease, I must nevertheless be going -

LAMP : Captain, please stay.  Due to excessive instancing, the
	genetic patterns of my people are identical.  Without
	variety, our species is threatened with extinction.  If you
	do not impregnate all the young women on our planet, we are
	doomed.

KIRK : < righteously > If there is one law that we live by, it is
	that all species have the right to survive.  Bones, help me
	service all these women.

MCCOY : Dammit, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a firehydrant.
