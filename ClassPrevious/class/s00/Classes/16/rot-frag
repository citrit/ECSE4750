Subject 5.04: After calling glRotate() a few times I end up rotating
     around the wrong axis. Why?

     This problem is commonly referred to as Gimble Lock. It is a
     problem inherent in using 3 angles to describe an orientation
     and is mentioned in just about every 3D graphics book in
     existence. Typical solutions are to use a different representation
     for orientation. The common ones are; Matrix, Axis/Angle, and
     Quaternions.
