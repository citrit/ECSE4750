Class 30, Tues Nov 9 </H1>

<h1><a name="01"></a>Computer Graphics and Being Blind (Enrichment)</h1>

<p>Here's a real-world dilemma for Computer Graphics.  Seeing a static
image is 2-D; you can appreciate how things are arranged, and relate
to each other, on a screen.  A good arrangement helps you understand
the screen better.  (I not even considering seeing a dynamic image.)
Hearing is 1-D, including when a speech synthesizer interprets a
screen for a blind person.  10% of the population is blind.  </p>

<p>How does this apply to the WWW?  Frames are 2-D.  The proper use of
frames makes web pages more understandable for people who can see, but
less understandable for people who can't.  Is this a reason not to use
them?  The folks at the WWW Consortium who standardize HTML feel so;
they have refused to include a useful implementation of frames in
Amaya, their demo browser.  </p>

<p>Relatedly, AOL was recently sued since some of their screens aren't
compatible with SW that interprets screens for the blind.  </p>

<p>Dunno the correct answer here; but you live in the real world.
This is a typical issue you have to face.  </p>

<p>However, one observation is that computer technology has been the
best thing ever for people who are handicapped.  E.g., Braille, which
few blind people actually ever learned, and which was slow and
tedious, has been obsoleted by speech synthesizer SW.  E.g., for about
10 years now, RPI's library has had a Kurzweil machine to read books.
</p>

<h1><a name="02"></a>Bill Gates Interview</h1>

<p>Bill Gates will be on TV, on CBS at 9 tonite (Nov 9).  Presumably
he won't be singing "Twinkle twinkle little star".  </p>

<h1><a name="03"></a>Quaternions (Enrichment)</h1>

<p>This is an alternative way to do 3D rotations.  People who combine
successive rotations, like with robotics and spacecraft, and people
who interpolate rotations, like animators, like quaternions.
</p>


<!--
<h1><a name="04"></a>So What's All This "Enrichment" Stuff?</h1>
-->

<h1><a name="05"></a>2D Rotating a Bitmap</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Method 1: for each destination pixel, find the source pixel and copy.
Maybe combine a group of neighbors.

<li><p>Method 2: Do the rotation by 3 affine transformations (sliding), which
are easy.
</p></li>

</ol>

</p></li>

<h1><a name="06"></a>Transformations in General</h1>

<ol>

<li><p>See the text for details.</p></li>

<li><p>Some common transformations are translation, scaling, rotation,
projection.</p></li>

<li><p>Homogeneous coords make a translation into a matrix multiply, like the 
others.
</p></li>

<li><p>Now, several successive transformations can be combined into one
matrix, which is then applied to the points in the object.
</p></li>

</ol>

<h1><a name="07"></a>Homogeneous Coordinates</h1>

<ol>

<li><p>In 3D, the homogeneous point (x<sub>h</sub>,y<sub>h</sub>,z<sub>h</sub>,h) corresponds to the Cartesian
point (x<sub>h</sub>/h, y<sub>h</sub>/h, z<sub>h</sub>/h).  
</p></li>

<li><p>There are an infinite number of homogeneous ways to represent each
Cartesian point.  E.g., (1,1,1,1), (2,2,2,2) and (3,3,3,3) all correspond to the Cartesian point (1,1,1).
</p></li>

<li><p>For finite points, h is not 0.</p></li>

</ol>


<p>Advantages:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Translation is a matrix multiply.  To translate by (dx,dy,dz),
multiply by this.

<p>
</p>


<li><p>Projection is a matrix multiply.  To project onto the viewplane z=1
with the center at (0,0,0), the equations are thus:
</p>

<center>
x' = x/z<br>
y' = y/z<br>
z' = 1<br>
</center>

<p>This is the same as multiplying by this matrix:</p>

</TABLE>

</p>
<p>
</p>


<li><p>Points at infinity can be represented.  (1,2,3,0) is the infinite
point at the end of the line from the origin thru Cartesian (1,2,3).  
</p></li>

<li><p>Therefore, a parallel projection has the same form as a perspective
projection, with an infinite center of projection.
</p></li>

<li><p>In 2-D, every pair of lines intersects.  Two parallel lines intersect at
infinity.  What is the intersection of  x=0 and x=1?  Write the
equations homogeneously thus:
</p>

<center>
1x + 0y + 0h = 0<br>
1x + 0y - 1h = 0<br>
</center>

<p>(All homogeneous equations have 0 as the constant.)   The solution is
x=0, h=0, y=anything.  The lines intersect at (0,1,0).    Note that
(0,2,0), (0,3,0), etc, are the same point.
</p>

<li><p>Every two different points have one line thru them.  If both points
are infinite, this is the line at infinity, which contains all
infinite points.
</p>

<li><p>Computer aided design uses homogeneous points with 'h' being the
weight that a point has when approximating a curve near it.   In homogeneous 2D,
(1,1,1) and (2,2,2) are the same point, but using (2,2,2) will make
the approximating curve come closer.
</p></li>


<li><p>Suppose we want to represent a circle parametrically.  Using Cartesian
coordinates, there is no way to do this exactly with polynomials.
However, here is an exact homogeneous rep:
</p>

<center>
x<sub>h</sub> = t<sup>2</sup>-1<br>
y<sub>h</sub> = 2t <br>
h = t<sup>2</sup>+1<br>
</center>
