<h1>Convenience Functions:</h1>

<ol>
    <li>Another more elaborate example of convenience functions
        is <a
        href="http://devcentral.iftech.com/learning/tutorials/misc/motif/9.asp">http://devcentral.iftech.com/learning/tutorials/misc/motif/9.asp</a></li>
    <li>This also shows contraints and uses convenience functions
        supplied by Motif: <a href="xeditor.c">xeditor.c</a></li>
</ol>

<h1><a name="02"></a>X Stuff</h1>

<p>Here are hints about more X functionality.</p>

<h2><a name="03"></a>Unused Command Line Args</h2>

<p>This program, <a href="xuserargs.c">xuserargs.c</a>, prints
any command-line args that XtVaAppInitialize doesn't recognize. </p>

<p>Try these:</p>

<pre>
xuserargs
xuserargs -bg red
xuserargs -hi -bg red -bye 3
</pre>

<h2><a name="04"></a>Man X</h2>

<p>This is the <a
href="http://www.motifzone.com/resources/man/X.html">X man page</a>.
It lists all the standard command-line args. </p>

<h2><a name="05"></a>Events</h2>

<p>There are 33 types of events, see <a
href="http://www.motifzone.com/resources/man/XAnyEvent.html">man
XAnyEvent</a> </p>

<h2><a name="06"></a>Color Maps</h2>

<p>X supports frame buffers with depths from 1 bit deep on up. It
also supports color maps, with the user having total control.
There are also several ways to specify colors; see man X.</p>

<h2><a name="07"></a>Fonts</h2>

<p>Fonts can be specified at runtime, like other resources.
Wildcards and alternate names are allowed. There can be
designated font servers.</p>

<h2><a name="08"></a>Drawing Lines, Polygons, etc</h2>

<p>The Xlib level of X does this. It's complicated. I used to
talk about it in class. </p>

<h1><a name="10"></a>Debugging Hints</h1>

<h2><a name="11"></a>Meaning of Pointer -- Integer Warning</h2>

<p>What causes this?</p>

<p><tt>warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a
cast</tt> </p>

<p>One common reason is that you didn't declare a routine that
returns a pointer. Then the routine type defaults to int. This
can happen if you copy some code from <em>xbox</em> to <em>xtext</em>
w/o also copying the affiliated include files. E.g., <em>XmCreatePromptDialog</em>
needs </p>

<p><tt>#include &lt;Xm/SelectioB.h&gt; </tt></p>

<p>See the man page or programmers guide.</p>

<h2><a name="12"></a>Perror</h2>

<p>Check the error code returned by <tt>open</tt>, <tt>read</tt>,
etc. If it's an error (possibly shown by -1), then in addition
possibly to printing your own error message, call <tt>perror</tt>
to print the reason for failing. See the man page. </p>

<h2><a name="13"></a>Graphical debuggers</h2>

<p><tt>ddd</tt> and <tt>xxgdb</tt> are useful graphical debuggers
to see where the program crashed, run it again line by line, etc.
The following was posted to <tt>rpi.rcs</tt> by
wilmesj@sage3101-11.its.rpi.edu (Josh Wilmes) in November 97. </p>

<p>``The Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a novel graphical user
interface to GDB and DBX, the popular UNIX debuggers. Besides
``usual'' features such as viewing source texts and breakpoints,
DDD provides a *graphical data display*, where data structures
are displayed as graphs. A simple mouse click dereferences
pointers or reveals structure contents. Complex data structures
can be explored incrementally and interactively, using automatic
layout if preferred. Each time the program stops, the data
display reflects the current variable values. Using DDD, you can
reason about your application by viewing its data, not just by
viewing it execute lines of source code. </p>

<p>``DDD is available through the ACM Bin-Man service. For more
info on the service, see /dept/acm/Bin-Man.Service.'' </p>

<h2><a name="14"></a>I/O in C</h2>

<p>There are two ways to do this: either with the routines <tt>open</tt>,
<tt>read</tt>, <tt>write</tt>, and <tt>close</tt>, or with the
routines <tt>fopen</tt>, <tt>fread</tt>, <tt>fwrite</tt>, and <tt>fclose</tt>.
I recommend the first set. Since you are reading files that are
much smaller than your memory, declare a large buffer and read
the whole file in one call. Calling <tt>getc</tt> in a loop is
crazy. </p>

<p>When using <tt>open</tt> to create a file, use the third
argument to give a mode such as 0600. Otherwise, <tt>open</tt>
might create the file nonwritable, and the next time that you run
your program, it won't be able to write it. </p>

<p>Here's a sample program, <a href="testopen.c"><tt>testopen.c</tt></a>.
</p>

<h2><a name="15"></a>Unix Man Usage</h2>

<p>If there are both a command and a routine with the same name,
as for <tt>write</tt>, <tt>man</tt> will give you the command man
page. <tt>man -k write</tt> will list all the man pages with <tt>write</tt>
as part of the title line. <tt>man 2 write</tt> will list the
routine's man page, which is in volume 2. </p>

<h1><a name="16"></a>More on Online Documentation</h1>

<p>For example, here is how to find the chapter on color in the
online Xlib Programming Manual on the SGIs.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Look at the menu that should be on your screen, which
        looks like this. <p><img src="sgidoc1.gif" width="124"
        height="159"> </p>
    </li>
    <li>Click on <em>Help</em>, to cause a menu like this to
        appear.<p><img src="sgidoc2.gif" width="119" height="130">
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>Click on <em>Online Books</em>, to cause a window like
        this.<p><img src="sgidoc3.gif" width="550" height="700"> </p>
    </li>
    <li>Double click on <em>Xlib Programming Manual</em>, to
        cause a window like this.<p><img src="sgidoc4.gif"
        width="642" height="730"> </p>
    </li>
    <li>Scroll thru the Table of Contents in the upper window to
        find <em>Chapter 7 - Color</em>. </li>
    <li>If you wish, click on <em>+</em> to expand the table of
        contents.</li>
    <li>Double click on chapter 7 to display the text in the
        lower window.</li>
    <li>Scroll thru it.</li>
    <li>Don't try to read every detail. You want only an
        introduction and executive summary.</li>
</ol>

<h1><a name="09"></a>Homework 4 --- due Thurs Feb 10</h1>

<p>The main part of this homework is to write a usable text
editor, which is surprisingly easy given the Motif widgets, which
have already done most of the work.</p>

<p>* Do not hand in anything for the starred questions.</p>

<ol>
    <li>What is special about a cascade button? (Ref: the Motif
        Programming Guide, chapter 6.)</li>
    <li>``The windows associated with PopupMenus and
        PulldownMenus are top-level windows. That is, the parent
        window of such a menu is the root window of the screen,
        not the window associated with the parent widget.'' What
        advantage is there to this? (same ref.)</li>
    <li>Read chapter 1 of the <em>Motif Progamming Guide</em>,
        which has an excellent capsule summary of X, and answer
        these questions from it. <ol>
            <li>Tell us the definition of a <em>GUI</em>. </li>
            <li>Tell us the definition of an <em>API</em>. </li>
            <li>What, fundamentally, is the <em>X Window System</em>?
            </li>
            <li>In one sentence, what is a <em>display</em>? </li>
            <li>What are the three most important contributions
                of {Xt}? </li>
            <li>What is the main function of a <em>shell widget</em>?
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>* Compile and play with <a href="../05/xdrawing.c">xdrawing.c</a></li>
    <li>* Change the coordinates of the end points.</li>
    <li>* Draw more lines and Points.</li>
    <li>* Change the color of the GC. </li>
    <li>* Check out the events being sent to your application. Is
        there enough to create a drawing program?</li>
    <li>Now that you understand xdrawing, your real homework is
        to extend it to make an actual, usable, drawing app. Add
        two buttons that represent the current drawing tool. One
        is a line tool and the other is a point tool. When the
        user presses the mouse button over the canvas your
        application should draw according to the current tool and
        color. If the line tool is active, you need to capture
        the mouse down and mouse up events to get the beginning
        and end of the line. If the point tool is active you can
        simply capture the mouse down and simply draw a
        point.Here are some hints:<ul>
            <li>Lookup XtGetGC and XChangeGC for info on changing
                the current color.</li>
            <li>Take a look at this code snippet for color
                allocation: <a href="get_pixel.c">get_pixel.c</a></li>
            <li>Popup a dialog to ask for color as a string in
                the form &quot;r,g,b&quot; and parse it
                internally to get the pixel.</li>
            <li>Extra credit for people who create a better color
                chooser. (one that works and is easy to use).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Get a screendump showing your name in the title bar of
        your app and some drawing. Hand it, and a code listing
        in. (You don't need to hand in a color print out.</li>
</ol>

<h1><a name="17"></a>Tcl/tk --- Another Widget Set</h1>

<p>There are other widget sets besides Motif. For example, Athena
is the demo widget set that comes with X. It's free with source
code, but is not as fancy. Here is another one, which I'll cover
as part of this course.</p>

<p><tt>Tcl</tt> is an interpreted language designed by John
Ousterhout at UC Berkeley, with funding from ARPA. Its purpose is
to facilitate interactive programs. It is becoming very widely
used. It even runs from Netscape and Internet Explorer as a
plugin. According to the man page,</p>

<p>It is actually two things: a language and a library. First,
Tcl is a simple textual language, intended primarily for issuing
commands to interactive programs such as text editors, debuggers,
illustrators, and shells. It has a simple syntax and is also
programmable, so Tcl users can write command procedures to
provide more powerful com- mands than those in the built-in set.
Second, Tcl is a library package that can be embedded in
application programs.</p>

<p>Several packages are built on top, such as <tt>expect</tt> and
<tt>Tk</tt>. Expect is unrelated to this course, but is cool.
From its man page,</p>

<p>Expect is a program that ``talks'' to other interactive
programs according to a script. Following the script, expect
knows what can be expected from a program and what the correct
response should be. An interpreted language provides branching
and high-level control structures to direct the dialogue.
(Alternatively, the user may use the C language directly. See
libexpect(3).) In addition, the user can take control and
interact directly when desired, afterward returning control to
the script. Some applications are these:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Cause your computer to dial you back, so that you can
        login without paying for the call.</li>
    <li>Start a game (e.g., rogue) and if the optimal
        configuration doesn't appear, restart it (again and
        again) until it does, then hand over control to you.</li>
</ol>

<p><tt>Tk</tt> is an X11 toolkit that provides the Motif look and
feel and is implemented using the Tcl scripting language.
Programs are much shorter than similar C programs, tho they
execute more slowly. There are many demo programs in <tt>/campus/tcl/tk/4.2/common/lib/tk4.2/demos/</tt>.
To run them, you need <tt>/campus/tcl/tk/4.2/</tt>whatever<tt>/bin/</tt>
in your PATH, then just type the name of the program, such as <tt>hello</tt>,
the Tcl/Tk equivalent of our <tt>xgoodbye</tt>. This is its code.
</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
# the next line restarts using wish \
exec wish4.2 &quot;$0&quot; &quot;$@&quot;

# hello --
# Simple Tk script to create a button that prints &quot;Hello, world&quot;.
# Click on the button to terminate the program.
#
# SCCS: @(#) hello 1.6 96/02/16 10:49:18
# 
# The first line below creates the button, and the second line
# asks the packer to shrink-wrap the application's main window
# around the button.

button .hello -text &quot;Hello, world&quot; -command {
    puts stdout &quot;Hello, world&quot;; destroy .
}
pack .hello
</pre>

<p><tt>widget</tt> shows many examples, such as editing arrow
sizes: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="arrow.gif" width="516" height="600"> </p>

<p>and navigating around a floorplan for DEC's Westerm Research
Lab. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="decwrlfloor.gif" width="937"
height="731"> </p>

<p>Here is a tiny line drawing program, <a href="stroker.tcl">stroker.tcl</a>
from Sunlabs. ``Start drawing by pressing the left mouse button,
then draw a line by moving the mouse. When you release the left
mouse button, the line gets entered into the canvas. You can
delete a line by pressing the DEL key while the mouse is over a
line.'' Here is some sample output.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="stroker.gif" width="412" height="430">
</p>

<p>The code is just 32 lines. </p>

<p>Here is a Tcl/Tk intro for the SGIs. It may work similarly on
other platforms, depending the on Tcl version there. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Type <tt>wish</tt> to start the interactive widget shell
        to get this:<p><img src="tcl1.gif" width="208"
        height="226"> </p>
    </li>
    <li>Create a label widget: <tt>label .a -text Hi </tt></li>
    <li>and realize it: <tt>pack .a</tt><p><img src="tcl2.gif"
        width="30" height="50"> </p>
    </li>
    <li>Change its color: <tt>.a configure -fg red -bg cyan</tt></li>
    <li>and its label: <tt>.a configure -text bonjour</tt>:<p><img
        src="tcl3.gif" width="75" height="50"> </p>
    </li>
    <li>Make another label: <tt>label .b -text { This is a longer
        message }</tt></li>
    <li>and realize it also: <tt>pack .b</tt>:<p><img
        src="tcl4.gif" width="220" height="74"> </p>
    </li>
    <li>Make a button with a callback and realize it:<pre>
button .err -text {I'm an error message.
Press me to remove.} \
-font -*-courier-bold-r-*-*-*-200-*-*-*-*-*-* \
-fg red -command {destroy .err}
pack .err
</pre>
        <p>getting this.</p>
        <p><img src="tcl5.gif" width="397" height="158"> </p>
    </li>
    <li>Click on it.<p><img src="tcl6.gif" width="220"
        height="74"> </p>
    </li>
    <li>Make a popup dialog with a menu:<pre>
tk_dialog .ddd title {Pick your favorite curriculum:} \
{} 1 EE CSYS CS MATH
</pre>
        <p><img src="tcl7.gif" width="377" height="158"> </p>
        <p>and ensure your success in this course by picking the
        right choice. Its number, counting from 0, is returned.
        Do <tt>man dialog</tt> to see the args.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Make an entry widget, which provides a line for you to
        type input:<pre>
entry .ee -background green
pack .ee
</pre>
        <p><img src="tcl8.gif" width="220" height="102"> </p>
    </li>
    <li>Type something in the green space, then delete a few
        chars to show how you can edit the text, and get the
        result thus:<pre>
.ee delete 2 4
.ee get
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Finally, make a procedure to open a pipe to get the
        result of the date command and put that into a variable.
        Then make a button whose text is always the current value
        of that variable, and whose callback is that procedure.<pre>
proc getdate { } {
  global date
  set datef [open &quot;|date&quot;]
  set date [read $datef] 
  close $datef
}

getdate

button .printdate -textvariable date  -fg red -command getdate

pack .printdate
