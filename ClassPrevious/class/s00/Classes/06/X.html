NAME
     <A HREF="X.html">X</A> - a portable, network-transparent window system

SYNOPSIS
     The <A HREF="X.html">X</A> Window System is a network transparent  window  system
     which  runs  on  a  wide  range  of  computing  and graphics
     machines.  It should be relatively straightforward to  build
     the <A HREF="X.html">X</A> Window System software distribution on most ANSI C and
     POSIX compliant  systems.   Commercial  implementations  are
     also available for a wide range of platforms.

     The Open Group requests that the  following  names  be  used
     when referring to this software:

                                  <A HREF="X.html">X</A>

DESCRIPTION
     <A HREF="X.html">X</A>  Window  System  servers  run  on  computers  with  <A HREF="bitmap.html">bitmap</A>
     displays.   The server distributes user input to and accepts
     output requests  from  various  client  programs  through  a
     variety  of  different  interprocess communication channels.
     Although the most common case is for the client programs  to
     be running on the same machine as the server, clients can be
     run transparently from other  machines  (including  machines
     with different architectures and operating systems) as well.

     <A HREF="X.html">X</A> supports overlapping hierarchical subwindows and text  and
     graphics  operations, on both monochrome and color displays.
     For a full explanation of the functions that are  available,

     Many other utilities, window managers, games, toolkits, etc.
     are  included  as  user-contributed software in the <A HREF="X.html">X</A> Window
     System distribution, or are available using anonymous ftp on
     the Internet.  See your site administrator for details.

STARTING UP
     There are two main ways of getting the <A HREF="X.html">X</A> server and an  ini-
     tial  set  of  client  applications started.  The particular
     method used depends on what operating system you are running
     and  whether or not you use other window systems in addition
     to <A HREF="X.html">X</A>.

     <I><A HREF="xdm.html">xdm</A></I> (the <A HREF="X.html">X</A> Display Manager)
             If you  want  to  always  have  <A HREF="X.html">X</A>  running  on  your
             display,   your  site  administrator  can  set  your
             machine up to use the <A HREF="X.html">X</A> Display Manager  <I><A HREF="xdm.html">xdm</A></I>.   This
             program  is  typically started by the system at boot
             time and takes care of keeping  the  server  running
             and  getting  users  logged  in.  If you are running
             <I><A HREF="xdm.html">xdm</A></I>, you will see a window on the  screen  welcoming
             you  to  the system and asking for your username and
             password.  Simply type them in as  you  would  at  a
             normal terminal, pressing the Return key after each.
             If you make a mistake, <I><A HREF="xdm.html">xdm</A></I>  will  display  an  error
             message  and  ask  you to try again.  After you have
             successfully logged in, <I><A HREF="xdm.html">xdm</A></I> will  start  up  your  <A HREF="X.html">X</A>
             environment.   By default, if you have an executable
             file named .<I>xsession</I> in  your  home  directory,  <I><A HREF="xdm.html">xdm</A></I>
             will  treat it as a program (or shell script) to run
             to start up your initial clients (such  as  terminal
             emulators,  clocks,  a window manager, user settings
             for things like the background,  the  speed  of  the
             pointer, etc.).  Your site administrator can provide
             details.

     <I><A HREF="xinit.html">xinit</A></I> (run manually from the shell)
             Sites that support more than one window system might
             choose to use the <I><A HREF="xinit.html">xinit</A></I> program for starting <A HREF="X.html">X</A> manu-
             ally.  If this is true for your machine,  your  site
             administrator  will probably have provided a program
             named "x11", "<A HREF="startx.html">startx</A>",  or  "xstart"  that  will  do
             site-specific  initialization  (such as loading con-
             venient default resources, running a window manager,
             displaying  a  clock,  and starting several terminal
             emulators) in a nice way.  If  not,  you  can  build
             such a script using the <I><A HREF="xinit.html">xinit</A></I> program.  This utility
             simply runs one user-specified program to start  the
             server,   runs  another  to  start  up  any  desired
             clients, and then waits for either to finish.  Since
             either or both of the user-specified programs may be
             a shell script, this gives  substantial  flexibility
             at  the  expense of a nice interface.  For this rea-
             son, <I><A HREF="xinit.html">xinit</A></I> is not intended for end users.

DISPLAY NAMES
     From the user's perspective, every <A HREF="X.html">X</A> server  has  a  <I>display</I>
     <I>name</I> of the form:

                 <I>hostname</I>:<I>displaynumber</I>.<I>screennumber</I>

     This information is used by the application to determine how
     it  should  connect to the server and which screen it should
     use by default (on displays with multiple monitors):

     <I>hostname</I>
             The <I>hostname</I> specifies the name of  the  machine  to
             which  the  display is physically connected.  If the
             hostname is not given, the  most  efficient  way  of
             communicating  to  a server on the same machine will
             be used.

     <I>displaynumber</I>
             The phrase "display" is usually  used  to  refer  to
             collection  of monitors that share a common keyboard
             and pointer (mouse, tablet,  etc.).   Most  worksta-
             tions tend to only have one keyboard, and therefore,
             only one display.  Larger, multi-user systems,  how-
             ever,  frequently have several displays so that more
             than one person can be doing graphics work at  once.
             To  avoid  confusion,  each  display on a machine is
             assigned a <I>display</I> <I>number</I> (beginning at 0) when  the
             <A HREF="X.html">X</A>  server  for that display is started.  The display
             number must always be given in a display name.

     <I>screennumber</I>
             Some displays share a single  keyboard  and  pointer
             among  two or more monitors.  Since each monitor has
             its own set of windows, each screen  is  assigned  a
             <I>screen</I> <I>number</I> (beginning at 0) when the <A HREF="X.html">X</A> server for
             that display is started.  If the  screen  number  is
             not given, screen 0 will be used.

     On POSIX systems, the default display name is stored in your
     DISPLAY environment variable.  This variable is set automat-
     ically by the <I><A HREF="xterm.html">xterm</A></I> terminal emulator.   However,  when  you
     log  into another machine on a network, you will need to set
     DISPLAY by hand to point to your display.  For example,

         % setenv DISPLAY myws:0
         $ DISPLAY=myws:0; export DISPLAY
     The <I><A HREF="xon.html">xon</A></I> script can be used to start an <A HREF="X.html">X</A> program on a remote
     machine;   it   automatically   sets  the  DISPLAY  variable
     correctly.

     Finally, most <A HREF="X.html">X</A> programs accept a  command  line  option  of
     -display <I>displayname</I> to temporarily override the contents of
     DISPLAY.  This is most  commonly  used  to  pop  windows  on
     another  person's screen or as part of a "remote shell" com-
     mand to start an <A HREF="xterm.html">xterm</A> pointing back to your  display.   For
     example,

         % xeyes -display joesws:0 -geometry 1000x1000+0+0
         % rsh big <A HREF="xterm.html">xterm</A> -display myws:0 -ls &lt;/dev/null &amp;

     <A HREF="X.html">X</A> servers listen for connections on a variety  of  different
     communications   channels   (network  byte  streams,  shared
     memory, etc.).  Since there can be more than one way of con-
     tacting  a  given  server,  The <I>hostname</I> part of the display
     name is used to determine the type of channel (also called a
     transport  layer)  to  be used.  <A HREF="X.html">X</A> servers generally support
     the following types of connections:

     <I>local</I>
             The hostname part of the display name should be  the
             empty  string.  For example:  :<I>0</I>, :<I>1</I>, and :<I>0</I>.<I>1</I>.  The
             most efficient local transport will be chosen.

     <I>TCP</I>/<I>IP</I>
             The hostname part of the display name should be  the
             server  machine's  IP  address  name.  Full Internet
             names, abbreviated names, and IP addresses  are  all
             allowed.     For    example:     <I>x</I>.<I>org</I>:<I>0</I>,    <I>expo</I>:<I>0</I>,
             <I>198</I>.<I>112</I>.<I>45</I>.<I>11</I>:<I>0</I>, <I>bigmachine</I>:<I>1</I>, and <I>hydra</I>:<I>0</I>.<I>1</I>.

     <I>DECnet</I>
             The hostname part of the display name should be  the
             server  machine's  nodename,  followed by two colons
             instead of one.  For example:  <I>myws</I>::<I>0</I>, <I>big</I>::<I>1</I>,  and
             <I>hydra</I>::<I>0</I>.<I>1</I>.


ACCESS CONTROL
     An <A HREF="X.html">X</A>  server  can  use  several  types  of  access  control.
     Mechanisms provided in Release 6 are:
         Host Access                   Simple host-based access control.
         MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1            Shared plain-text "cookies".
         XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1           Secure DES based private-keys.
         SUN-DES-1                     Based on Sun's secure rpc system.
         MIT-KERBEROS-5                Kerberos Version 5 user-to-user.

     <I>Xdm</I> initializes access  control  for  the  server  and  also
     places authorization information in a file accessible to the
     user.  Normally, the list of hosts  from  which  connections
     are  always  accepted  should be empty, so that only clients
     with are explicitly authorized can connect to  the  display.
     When  you  add  entries  to  the host list (with <I><A HREF="xhost.html">xhost</A></I>), the
     server no longer performs any authorization  on  connections
     from those machines.  Be careful with this.

     The file from which <I>Xlib</I> extracts authorization data can  be
     specified  with  the  environment  variable  XAUTHORITY, and
     defaults to the file .Xauthority in the home directory.  <I>Xdm</I>
     uses  $HOME/.Xauthority  and  will  create  it  or  merge in
     authorization records if it already exists when a user  logs
     in.

     If you use several machines and share a common  home  direc-
     tory  across  all of the machines by means of a network file
     system, you never really have to worry  about  authorization
     files,  the system should work correctly by default.  Other-
     wise, as the authorization  files  are  machine-independent,
     you  can  simply  copy  the  files to share them.  To manage
     authorization files, use <I><A HREF="xauth.html">xauth</A></I>.  This program allows you  to
     extract  records  and  insert  them into other files.  Using
     this, you can send authorization to remote machines when you
     login,  if  the  remote machine does not share a common home
     directory with your local machine.  Note that  authorization
     information  transmitted  ``in the clear'' through a network
     file system or using <I>ftp</I> or <I>rcp</I> can be ``stolen'' by a  net-
     work  eavesdropper,  and  as  such  may  enable unauthorized
     access.  In many environments, this level of <A HREF="security.html">security</A> is not
     a  concern,  but if it is, you need to know the exact seman-
     tics of the particular authorization data to know if this is
     actually a problem.

     For more information on access control,  see  the  <I>Xsecurity</I>
     manual page.

GEOMETRY SPECIFICATIONS
     One of the advantages of using  window  systems  instead  of
     hardwired  terminals  is  that applications don't have to be
     restricted to a particular size or location on  the  screen.
     Although the layout of windows on a display is controlled by
     the window manager  that  the  user  is  running  (described
     below),  most  <A HREF="X.html">X</A>  programs accept a command line argument of
     the  form  -geometry  <I>WIDTHxHEIGHT</I>+<I>XOFF</I>+<I>YOFF</I>  (where  <I>WIDTH</I>,
     <I>HEIGHT</I>,  <I>XOFF</I>,  and  <I>YOFF</I> are numbers) for specifying a pre-
     ferred size and location for this application's main window.

     The <I>WIDTH</I> and <I>HEIGHT</I> parts of the geometry specification are
     usually  measured  in either pixels or characters, depending
     on the application.  The <I>XOFF</I> and <I>YOFF</I> parts are measured in
     pixels  and  are  used to specify the distance of the window
     from the left or right and  top  and  bottom  edges  of  the
     screen,  respectively.   Both  types of offsets are measured
     from the indicated edge of the screen to  the  corresponding
     edge  of  the  window.  The <A HREF="X.html">X</A> offset may be specified in the
     following ways:

     +<I>XOFF</I>   The left edge of the window is  to  be  placed  <I>XOFF</I>
             pixels  in  from  the left edge of the screen (i.e.,
             the <A HREF="X.html">X</A> coordinate of  the  window's  origin  will  be
             <I>XOFF</I>).   <I>XOFF</I>  may  be  negative,  in which case the
             window's left edge will be off the screen.

     -<I>XOFF</I>   The right edge of the window is to  be  placed  <I>XOFF</I>
             pixels  in  from the right edge of the screen.  <I>XOFF</I>
             may be negative, in which case  the  window's  right
             edge will be off the screen.

     The Y offset has similar meanings:

     +<I>YOFF</I>   The top edge of the window  is  to  be  <I>YOFF</I>  pixels
             below  the top edge of the screen (i.e., the Y coor-
             dinate of the window's origin will be  <I>YOFF</I>).   <I>YOFF</I>
             may be negative, in which case the window's top edge
             will be off the screen.

     -<I>YOFF</I>   The bottom edge of the window is to be  <I>YOFF</I>  pixels
             above  the  bottom  edge of the screen.  <I>YOFF</I> may be
             negative, in which case  the  window's  bottom  edge
             will be off the screen.

     Offsets must be given as pairs; in other words, in order  to
     specify  either  <I>XOFF</I> or <I>YOFF</I> both must be present.  Windows
     can be placed in the four corners of the  screen  using  the
     following specifications:

     +<I>0</I>+<I>0</I>    upper left hand corner.

     -<I>0</I>+<I>0</I>    upper right hand corner.

     -<I>0</I>-<I>0</I>    lower right hand corner.

     +<I>0</I>-<I>0</I>    lower left hand corner.
     In the following examples, a terminal emulator is placed  in
     roughly the center of the screen and a load average monitor,
     mailbox, and clock  are  placed  in  the  upper  right  hand
     corner:

         <A HREF="xterm.html">xterm</A> -fn 6x10 -geometry 80x24+30+200 &amp;
         <A HREF="xclock.html">xclock</A> -geometry 48x48-0+0 &amp;
         xload -geometry 48x48-96+0 &amp;
         xbiff -geometry 48x48-48+0 &amp;

WINDOW MANAGERS
     The layout of windows on the screen is controlled by special
     programs  called  <I>window</I>  <I>managers</I>.   Although  many  window
     managers will honor geometry specifications as given, others
     may  choose to ignore them (requiring the user to explicitly
     draw the window's region on the screen with the pointer, for
     example).

     Since window managers are regular  (albeit  complex)  client
     programs,  a  variety  of  different  user interfaces can be
     built.  The <A HREF="X.html">X</A> Window System distribution comes with a window
     manager  named <I><A HREF="twm.html">twm</A></I> which supports overlapping windows, popup
     menus, point-and-click or click-to-type input models,  title
     bars,  nice  icons  (and an icon manager for those who don't
     like separate icon windows).

     See the user-contributed software in  the  <A HREF="X.html">X</A>  Window  System
     distribution for other popular window managers.

FONT NAMES
     Collections of characters for displaying text and symbols in
     <A HREF="X.html">X</A> are known as <I>fonts</I>.  A font typically contains images that
     share a common appearance and look nice together (for  exam-
     ple,  a  single  size,  boldness, slant, and character set).
     Similarly, collections of fonts that are based on  a  common
     type  face  (the  variations are usually called roman, bold,
     italic, bold italic, oblique, and bold oblique)  are  called
     <I>families</I>.

     Fonts come in various sizes.  The <A HREF="X.html">X</A> server supports <I>scalable</I>
     fonts,  meaning it is possible to create a font of arbitrary
     size from a single source for the font.  The server supports
     scaling  from  <I>outline</I> fonts and <I><A HREF="bitmap.html">bitmap</A></I> fonts.  Scaling from
     outline fonts usually produces significantly better  results
     than scaling from <A HREF="bitmap.html">bitmap</A> fonts.

     An <A HREF="X.html">X</A> server can obtain fonts from individual files stored in
     directories  in  the  file  system, or from one or more font
     servers, or from a mixtures of directories and font servers.
     The  list  of  places the server looks when trying to find a
     font is controlled by its <I>font</I> <I>path</I>.  Although most  instal-
     lations  will choose to have the server start up with all of
     the commonly used font directories in  the  font  path,  the
     font  path can be changed at any time with the <I><A HREF="xset.html">xset</A></I> program.
     However, it is important  to  remember  that  the  directory
     names are on the server's machine, not on the application's.

     Bitmap font files are usually created by compiling a textual
     font  description  into  binary  form, using <I><A HREF="bdftopcf.html">bdftopcf</A></I>.  Font
     databases are created by running the  <I><A HREF="mkfontdir.html">mkfontdir</A></I>  program  in
     the  directory containing the source or compiled versions of
     the  fonts.   Whenever  fonts  are  added  to  a  directory,
     <I><A HREF="mkfontdir.html">mkfontdir</A></I>  should  be  rerun so that the server can find the
     new fonts.  To make the server  reread  the  font  database,
     reset  the font path with the <I><A HREF="xset.html">xset</A></I> program.  For example, to
     add a font to a private directory,  the  following  commands
     could be used:

         % cp newfont.pcf ~/myfonts
         % <A HREF="mkfontdir.html">mkfontdir</A> ~/myfonts
         % <A HREF="xset.html">xset</A> fp rehash

     The <I>xfontsel</I> and <I><A HREF="xlsfonts.html">xlsfonts</A></I> programs can  be  used  to  browse
     through the fonts available on a server.  Font names tend to
     be fairly long as they contain all of the information needed
     to  uniquely  identify  individual  fonts.   However,  the <A HREF="X.html">X</A>
     server supports wildcarding  of  font  names,  so  the  full
     specification

         -<I>adobe</I>-<I>courier</I>-<I>medium</I>-<I>r</I>-<I>normal</I>--<I>10</I>-<I>100</I>-<I>75</I>-<I>75</I>-<I>m</I>-<I>60</I>-<I>iso8859</I>-<I>1</I>

     might be abbreviated as:

         -*-<I>courier</I>-<I>medium</I>-<I>r</I>-<I>normal</I>--*-<I>100</I>-*-*-*-*-<I>iso8859</I>-<I>1</I>

     Because the shell also has special meanings  for  *  and  ?,
     wildcarded font names should be quoted:

         % <A HREF="xlsfonts.html">xlsfonts</A> -fn '-*-courier-medium-r-normal--*-100-*-*-*-*-*-*'

     The <I><A HREF="xlsfonts.html">xlsfonts</A></I> program can be used to list all  of  the  fonts
     that match a given pattern.  With no arguments, it lists all
     available fonts.  This will usually list the  same  font  at
     many  different  sizes.   To see just the base scalable font
     names, try using one of the following patterns:

         -*-*-*-*-*-*-<I>0</I>-<I>0</I>-<I>0</I>-<I>0</I>-*-<I>0</I>-*-*
         -*-*-*-*-*-*-<I>0</I>-<I>0</I>-<I>75</I>-<I>75</I>-*-<I>0</I>-*-*
         -*-*-*-*-*-*-<I>0</I>-<I>0</I>-<I>100</I>-<I>100</I>-*-<I>0</I>-*-*

     To convert one of the resulting  names  into  a  font  at  a
     specific  size,  replace  one  of the first two zeros with a
     nonzero value.  The field containing the first zero  is  for
     the  pixel size; replace it with a specific height in pixels
     to name a font at that size.  Alternatively, the field  con-
     taining  the  second  zero is for the point size; replace it
     with a specific size in decipoints (there  are  722.7  deci-
     points  to  the inch) to name a font at that size.  The last
     zero is an average width field, measured in tenths  of  pix-
     els; some servers will anamorphically scale if this value is
     specified.

FONT SERVER NAMES
     One of the following forms can be used to name a font server
     that accepts TCP connections:

         tcp/<I>hostname</I>:<I>port</I>
         tcp/<I>hostname</I>:<I>port</I>/<I>cataloguelist</I>

     The <I>hostname</I> specifies the name (or decimal numeric address)
     of  the  machine  on  which the font server is running.  The
     <I>port</I> is the decimal TCP port on which  the  font  server  is
     listening  for  connections.   The <I>cataloguelist</I> specifies a
     list of catalogue names, with '+' as a separator.

     Examples: <I>tcp</I>/<I>x</I>.<I>org</I>:<I>7100</I>, <I>tcp</I>/<I>198</I>.<I>112</I>.<I>45</I>.<I>11</I>:<I>7100</I>/<I>all</I>.

     One of the following forms can be used to name a font server
     that accepts DECnet connections:

         decnet/<I>nodename</I>::font$<I>objname</I>
         decnet/<I>nodename</I>::font$<I>objname</I>/<I>cataloguelist</I>

     The <I>nodename</I> specifies the name (or decimal numeric address)
     of  the  machine  on  which the font server is running.  The
     <I>objname</I> is a normal, case-insensitive  DECnet  object  name.
     The  <I>cataloguelist</I> specifies a list of catalogue names, with
     '+' as a separator.

     Examples:                       <I>DECnet</I>/<I>SRVNOD</I>::<I>FONT</I>$<I>DEFAULT</I>,
     <I>decnet</I>/<I>44</I>.<I>70</I>::<I>font</I>$<I>special</I>/<I>symbols</I>.

COLOR NAMES
     Most applications provide ways of tailoring (usually through
     resources  or  command line arguments) the colors of various
     elements in the text and graphics they display.  A color can
     be  specified  either  by  an  abstract  color name, or by a
     numerical color specification.  The numerical  specification
     can  identify  a  color  in either device-dependent (RGB) or
     device-independent   terms.    Color   strings   are   case-
     insensitive.

     <A HREF="X.html">X</A> supports the use of abstract  color  names,  for  example,
     "red",  "blue".   A value for this abstract name is obtained
     by searching one or more color name databases.   <I>Xlib</I>  first
     searches  zero  or  more  client-side databases; the number,
     location, and content of these databases  is  implementation
     dependent.  If the name is not found, the color is looked up
     in the <A HREF="X.html">X</A> server's database.  The text form of this  database
     is  commonly  stored  in  the  file &lt;<I>XRoot</I>&gt;/<I>lib</I>/<I>X11</I>/<I>rgb</I>.<I>txt</I>,
     where &lt;XRoot&gt; is replaced by the root  of  the  X11  install
     tree.

     A numerical color specification consists of  a  color  space
     name and a set of values in the following syntax:

         &lt;<I>color</I>_<I>space</I>_<I>name</I>&gt;:&lt;<I>value</I>&gt;/.../&lt;<I>value</I>&gt;

     An RGB Device specification  is  identified  by  the  prefix
     "rgb:" and has the following syntax:

         rgb:&lt;<I>red</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>green</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>blue</I>&gt;

             &lt;<I>red</I>&gt;, &lt;<I>green</I>&gt;, &lt;<I>blue</I>&gt; := <I>h</I> | <I>hh</I> | <I>hhh</I> | <I>hhhh</I>
             <I>h</I> := single hexadecimal digits
     Note that <I>h</I> indicates the value scaled in  4  bits,  <I>hh</I>  the
     value scaled in 8 bits, <I>hhh</I> the value scaled in 12 bits, and
     <I>hhhh</I> the value  scaled  in  16  bits,  respectively.   These
     values  are passed directly to the <A HREF="X.html">X</A> server, and are assumed
     to be gamma corrected.

     The eight primary colors can be represented as:

         black                rgb:0/0/0
         red                  rgb:ffff/0/0
         green                rgb:0/ffff/0
         blue                 rgb:0/0/ffff
         yellow               rgb:ffff/ffff/0
         magenta              rgb:ffff/0/ffff
         cyan                 rgb:0/ffff/ffff
         white                rgb:ffff/ffff/ffff

     For backward compatibility, an older syntax for  RGB  Device
     is  supported, but its continued use is not encouraged.  The
     syntax is an initial sharp  sign  character  followed  by  a
     numeric specification, in one of the following formats:

         #RGB                      (4 bits each)
         #RRGGBB                   (8 bits each)
         #RRRGGGBBB                (12 bits each)
         #RRRRGGGGBBBB             (16 bits each)

     The R, G, and B represent single hexadecimal  digits.   When
     fewer  than  16  bits each are specified, they represent the
     most-significant bits of the value (unlike the  "rgb:"  syn-
     tax,  in which values are scaled).  For example, #3a7 is the
     same as #3000a0007000.

     An RGB intensity specification is identified by  the  prefix
     "rgbi:" and has the following syntax:

         rgbi:&lt;<I>red</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>green</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>blue</I>&gt;

     The red, green, and blue are floating point  values  between
     0.0  and  1.0,  inclusive.   They represent linear intensity
     values, with 1.0 indicating full intensity, 0.5 half  inten-
     sity,  and  so  on.  These values will be gamma corrected by
     <I>Xlib</I> before being sent to the <A HREF="X.html">X</A> server.   The  input  format
     for  these  values  is an optional sign, a string of numbers
     possibly  containing  a  decimal  point,  and  an   optional
     exponent  field  containing an E or e followed by a possibly
     signed integer string.

     The standard device-independent string  specifications  have
     the following syntax:

         CIEXYZ:&lt;<I><A HREF="X.html">X</A></I>&gt;/&lt;<I>Y</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>Z</I>&gt;             (<I>none</I>, 1, <I>none</I>)
         CIEuvY:&lt;<I>u</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>v</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>Y</I>&gt;             (~.6, ~.6, 1)
         CIExyY:&lt;<I>x</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>y</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>Y</I>&gt;             (~.75, ~.85, 1)
         CIELab:&lt;<I>L</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>a</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>b</I>&gt;             (100, <I>none</I>, <I>none</I>)
         CIELuv:&lt;<I>L</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>u</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>v</I>&gt;             (100, <I>none</I>, <I>none</I>)
         TekHVC:&lt;<I>H</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>V</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>C</I>&gt;             (360, 100, 100)

     All of the values (C, H, V, <A HREF="X.html">X</A>, Y, Z, a, b, u, v, y,  x)  are
     floating  point  values.  Some of the values are constrained
     to be between zero and some upper bound;  the  upper  bounds
     are given in parentheses above.  The syntax for these values
     is an optional '+' or '-' sign, a string of digits  possibly
     containing  a  decimal point, and an optional exponent field
     consisting of an 'E' or 'e' followed by an optional  '+'  or
     '-' followed by a string of digits.

     <I>Xlib</I> reference manual.

KEYBOARDS
     The <A HREF="X.html">X</A> keyboard model is broken  into  two  layers:   server-
     specific  codes (called <I>keycodes</I>) which represent the physi-
     cal keys, and server-independent  symbols  (called  <I>keysyms</I>)
     which  represent  the  letters  or  words that appear on the
     keys.  Two tables are kept in the server for converting key-
     codes to keysyms:

     <I>modifier</I> <I>list</I>
             Some keys (such as Shift, Control,  and  Caps  Lock)
             are  known  as  <I>modifier</I> and are used to select dif-
             ferent symbols that are attached  to  a  single  key
             (such   as   Shift-a  generates  a  capital  A,  and
             Control-l generates a control  character  ^L).   The
             server keeps a list of keycodes corresponding to the
             various modifier keys.  Whenever a key is pressed or
             released,  the  server  generates an <I>event</I> that con-
             tains the keycode of the indicated key as well as  a
             mask  that  specifies which of the modifier keys are
             currently pressed.  Most servers set up this list to
             initially  contain  the  various shift, control, and
             shift lock keys on the keyboard.

     <I>keymap</I> <I>table</I>
             Applications translate event keycodes  and  modifier
             masks  into  keysyms using a <I>keysym</I> <I>table</I> which con-
             tains one row for each keycode and  one  column  for
             various  modifier states.  This table is initialized
             by the server to  correspond  to  normal  typewriter
             conventions.   The  exact semantics of how the table
             is interpreted to produce  keysyms  depends  on  the
             particular  program,  libraries,  and language input
             method used, but the following conventions  for  the
             first four keysyms in each row are generally adhered
             to:

     The first four elements of  the  list  are  split  into  two
     groups  of  keysyms.   Group 1 contains the first and second
     keysyms; Group 2 contains  the  third  and  fourth  keysyms.
     Within  each  group,  if the first element is alphabetic and
     the the second element is the special keysym <I>NoSymbol</I>,  then
     the  group  is treated as equivalent to a group in which the
     first element is the lowercase letter and the second element
     is the uppercase letter.

     Switching between groups is controlled by the  keysym  named
     MODE  SWITCH,  by  attaching  that  keysym  to  some key and
     attaching that key to any one of the modifiers Mod1  through
     Mod5.  This modifier is called the ``group modifier.'' Group
     1 is used when the group modifier is off,  and  Group  2  is
     used when the group modifier is on.

     Within a group, the modifier state determines  which  keysym
     to  use.   The  first keysym is used when the Shift and Lock
     modifiers are off.  The second keysym is used when the Shift
     modifier  is on, when the Lock modifier is on and the second
     keysym is uppercase alphabetic, or when the Lock modifier is
     on  and  is  interpreted  as ShiftLock.  Otherwise, when the
     Lock modifier is on and  is  interpreted  as  CapsLock,  the
     state  of  the  Shift  modifier is applied first to select a
     keysym; but if that keysym is lowercase alphabetic, then the
     corresponding uppercase keysym is used instead.

OPTIONS
     Most <A HREF="X.html">X</A> programs attempt to use the same  names  for  command
     line  options  and arguments.  All applications written with
     the <A HREF="X.html">X</A> Toolkit Intrinsics automatically accept the  following
     options:

     -display <I>display</I>
             This option specifies the name of the  <A HREF="X.html">X</A>  server  to
             use.

     -geometry <I>geometry</I>
             This option specifies the initial size and  location
             of the window.

     -bg <I>color</I>, -background <I>color</I>
             Either option specifies the color  to  use  for  the
             window background.

     -bd <I>color</I>, -bordercolor <I>color</I>
             Either option specifies the color  to  use  for  the
             window border.

     -bw <I>number</I>, -borderwidth <I>number</I>
             Either option specifies the width in pixels  of  the
             window border.

     -fg <I>color</I>, -foreground <I>color</I>
             Either option specifies the color to use for text or
             graphics.

     -fn <I>font</I>, -font <I>font</I>
             Either option specifies the font to use for display-
             ing text.

     -iconic
             This option indicates that  the  user  would  prefer
             that  the  application's  windows  initially  not be
             visible as if the windows had be immediately  iconi-
             fied by the user.  Window managers may choose not to
             honor the application's request.

     -name
             This option specifies the name under which resources
             for the application should be found.  This option is
             useful in shell aliases to distinguish between invo-
             cations  of  an  application,  without  resorting to
             creating links to alter the executable file name.

     -rv, -reverse
             Either option  indicates  that  the  program  should
             simulate  reverse  video if possible, often by swap-
             ping the foreground and background colors.  Not  all
             programs  honor  this or implement it correctly.  It
             is usually only used on monochrome displays.

     +rv
             This option indicates that the  program  should  not
             simulate  reverse  video.   This is used to override
             any defaults since reverse video doesn't always work
             properly.

     -selectionTimeout
             This option specifies the  timeout  in  milliseconds
             within  which  two  communicating  applications must
             respond to one another for a selection request.

     -synchronous
             This option indicates that requests to the <A HREF="X.html">X</A>  server
             should  be  sent synchronously, instead of asynchro-
             nously.  Since <I>Xlib</I> normally buffers requests to the
             server,  errors  do  not  necessarily  get  reported
             immediately after they occur.  This option turns off
             the   buffering  so  that  the  application  can  be
             debugged.  It should never be used  with  a  working
             program.

     -title <I>string</I>
             This option specifies the title to be used for  this
             window.   This  information  is  sometimes used by a
             window manager to provide some sort of header  iden-
             tifying the window.

     -xnllanguage <I>language</I>[_<I>territory</I>][.<I>codeset</I>]
             This option specifies the language,  territory,  and
             codeset  for  use  in  resolving  resource and other
             filenames.

     -xrm <I>resourcestring</I>
             This option specifies a resource name and  value  to
             override  any  defaults.  It is also very useful for
             setting resources that don't have  explicit  command
             line arguments.

RESOURCES
     To make the tailoring of applications  to  personal  prefer-
     ences  easier,  <A HREF="X.html">X</A>  provides  a mechanism for storing default
     values for program resources (e.g. background color,  window
     title,  etc.)  Resources  are  specified as strings that are
     read in from various places  when  an  application  is  run.
     Program components are named in a hierarchical fashion, with
     each node in the hierarchy identified  by  a  class  and  an
     instance  name.   At the top level is the class and instance
     name of the application itself.  By  convention,  the  class
     name of the application is the same as the program name, but
     with  the first letter capitalized (e.g.  <I>Bitmap</I>  or  <I>Emacs</I>)
     although some programs that begin with the letter ``x'' also
     capitalize the second letter for historical reasons.

     The precise syntax for resources is:

     ResourceLine      = Comment | IncludeFile | ResourceSpec | &lt;empty line&gt;
     Comment           = "!" {&lt;any character except null or newline&gt;}
     IncludeFile       = "#" WhiteSpace "include" WhiteSpace FileName WhiteSpace
     FileName          = &lt;valid filename for operating system&gt;
     ResourceSpec      = WhiteSpace ResourceName WhiteSpace ":" WhiteSpace Value
     ResourceName      = [Binding] {Component Binding} ComponentName
     Binding           = "." | "*"
     WhiteSpace        = {&lt;space&gt; | &lt;horizontal tab&gt;}
     Component         = "?" | ComponentName
     ComponentName     = NameChar {NameChar}
     NameChar          = "a"-"z" | "A"-"Z" | "0"-"9" | "_" | "-"
     Value             = {&lt;any character except null or unescaped newline&gt;}

     Elements separated by vertical  bar  (|)  are  alternatives.
     Curly  braces  ({...})  indicate zero or more repetitions of
     the enclosed elements.   Square  brackets  ([...])  indicate
     that  the  enclosed element is optional.  Quotes ("...") are
     used around literal characters.

     IncludeFile lines are interpreted by replacing the line with
     the contents of the specified file.  The word "include" must
     be in lowercase.  The filename is  interpreted  relative  to
     the  directory  of  the  file  in which the line occurs (for
     example, if the filename contains no directory or contains a
     relative directory specification).

     If a ResourceName contains a contiguous sequence of  two  or
     more  Binding characters, the sequence will be replaced with
     single "." character if the sequence contains only "." char-
     acters,  otherwise the sequence will be replaced with a sin-
     gle "*" character.

     A resource database never contains more than one entry for a
     given  ResourceName.   If  a resource file contains multiple
     lines with the same ResourceName, the last line in the  file
     is used.

     Any whitespace character before or after the name  or  colon
     in  a  ResourceSpec  are ignored.  To allow a Value to begin
     with  whitespace,  the  two-character  sequence   ``\<I>space</I>''
     (backslash  followed by space) is recognized and replaced by
     a space character, and the two-character  sequence  ``\<I>tab</I>''
     (backslash  followed  by  horizontal  tab) is recognized and
     replaced by a horizontal tab character.  To allow a Value to
     contain   embedded  newline  characters,  the  two-character
     sequence ``\n'' is recognized  and  replaced  by  a  newline
     character.   To  allow  a Value to be broken across multiple
     lines in a text file,  the  two-character  sequence  ``\<I>new-</I>
     <I>line</I>''  (backslash  followed  by  newline) is recognized and
     removed from  the  value.   To  allow  a  Value  to  contain
     arbitrary   character  codes,  the  four-character  sequence
     ``\<I>nnn</I>'', where each <I>n</I> is a digit character in the range  of
     ``0''-``7'',  is  recognized and replaced with a single byte
     that contains the octal value  specified  by  the  sequence.
     Finally, the two-character sequence ``\\'' is recognized and
     replaced with a single backslash.

     When an application looks for the value of  a  resource,  it
     specifies  a complete path in the hierarchy, with both class
     and instance names.  However, resource  values  are  usually
     given with only partially specified names and classes, using
     pattern matching constructs.  An asterisk  (*)  is  a  loose
     binding  and  is used to represent any number of intervening
     components, including none.  A period (.) is a tight binding
     and  is used to separate immediately adjacent components.  A
     question mark (?) is used to match any single component name
     or  class.   A database entry cannot end in a loose binding;
     the final component (which cannot be "?") must be specified.
     The  lookup algorithm searches the resource database for the
     entry that most closely matches (is most specific  for)  the
     full name and class being queried.  When more than one data-
     base entry matches the full name and class, precedence rules
     are used to select just one.

     The full name and class are scanned from left to right (from
     highest  level in the hierarchy to lowest), one component at
     a time.  At each level, the corresponding  component  and/or
     binding  of  each  matching  entry  is determined, and these
     matching components and bindings are compared  according  to
     precedence  rules.   Each  of  the  rules is applied at each
     level, before moving to the next level, until a rule selects
     a single entry over all others.  The rules (in order of pre-
     cedence) are:

     1.   An entry that contains a  matching  component  (whether
          name, class, or "?") takes precedence over entries that
          elide the level (that is, entries that match the  level
          in a loose binding).

     2.   An entry with a matching  name  takes  precedence  over
          both  entries  with  a  matching class and entries that
          match using "?".  An entry with a matching class  takes
          precedence over entries that match using "?".

     3.   An entry preceded by a tight binding  takes  precedence
          over entries preceded by a loose binding.

     Programs based on the <A HREF="X.html">X</A> Tookit Intrinsics  obtain  resources
     from  the  following sources (other programs usually support
     some subset of these sources):

     RESOURCE_MANAGER root window property
             Any global resources that  should  be  available  to
             clients  on  all  machines  should  be stored in the
             RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of  the
             first  screen  using the <I><A HREF="xrdb.html">xrdb</A></I> program.  This is fre-
             quently taken care of when  the  user  starts  up  <A HREF="X.html">X</A>
             through the display manager or <I><A HREF="xinit.html">xinit</A></I>.

     SCREEN_RESOURCES root window property
             Any resources  specific  to  a  given  screen  (e.g.
             colors)  that  should be available to clients on all
             machines should be stored  in  the  SCREEN_RESOURCES
             property  on  the  root  window of that screen.  The
             <I><A HREF="xrdb.html">xrdb</A></I> program will sort resources  automatically  and
             place  them in RESOURCE_MANAGER or SCREEN_RESOURCES,
             as appropriate.

     application-specific files
             Directories named by the environment variable XUSER-
             FILESEARCHPATH or the environment variable XAPPLRES-
             DIR (which names a single directory and  should  end
             with  a '/' on POSIX systems), plus directories in a
             standard place (usually under &lt;XRoot&gt;/lib/X11/,  but
             this  can  be  overridden  with  the XFILESEARCHPATH
             environment   variable)   are   searched   for   for
             application-specific resources.  For example, appli-
             cation  default  resources  are  usually   kept   in
             &lt;XRoot&gt;/lib/X11/app-defaults/.   See  the  <I><A HREF="X.html">X</A></I> <I>Toolkit</I>
             <I>Intrinsics</I>  -  <I>C</I>  <I>Language</I>  <I>Interface</I>   manual   for
             details.

     XENVIRONMENT
             Any user-  and  machine-specific  resources  may  be
             specified  by  setting  the XENVIRONMENT environment
             variable to the name of a resource file to be loaded
             by  all  applications.   If  this  variable  is  not
             defined, a file named  $<I>HOME</I>/.Xdefaults-<I>hostname</I>  is
             looked  for  instead,  where <I>hostname</I> is the name of
             the host where the application is executing.

     -xrm <I>resourcestring</I>
             Resources can also be  specified  from  the  command
             line.   The <I>resourcestring</I> is a single resource name
             and value as shown above.  Note that if  the  string
             contains  characters interpreted by the shell (e.g.,
             asterisk), they must be quoted.  Any number of  -xrm
             arguments may be given on the command line.

     Program resources are organized into groups called  <I>classes</I>,
     so  that  collections of individual resources (each of which
     are called <I>instances</I>) can be set all at  once.   By  conven-
     tion,  the  instance name of a resource begins with a lower-
     case letter and  class  name  with  an  upper  case  letter.
     Multiple  word  resources  are  concatenated  with the first
     letter of the succeeding  words  capitalized.   Applications
     written with the <A HREF="X.html">X</A> Toolkit Intrinsics will have at least the
     following resources:

     background (class Background)
             This resource specifies the color  to  use  for  the
             window background.

     borderWidth (class BorderWidth)
             This resource specifies the width in pixels  of  the
             window border.

     borderColor (class BorderColor)
             This resource specifies the color  to  use  for  the
             window border.

     Most applications using the <A HREF="X.html">X</A> Toolkit Intrinsics  also  have
     the  resource  foreground (class Foreground), specifying the
     color to use for text and graphics within the window.

     By combining class and instance specifications,  application
     preferences  can  be set quickly and easily.  Users of color
     displays will frequently want to set  Background  and  Fore-
     ground  classes  to  particular  defaults.   Specific  color
     instances such  as  text  cursors  can  then  be  overridden
     without  having to define all of the related resources.  For
     example,

         <A HREF="bitmap.html">bitmap</A>*Dashed:  off
         XTerm*cursorColor:  gold
         XTerm*multiScroll:  on
         XTerm*jumpScroll:  on
         XTerm*reverseWrap:  on
         XTerm*curses:  on
         XTerm*Font:  6x10
         XTerm*scrollBar: on
         XTerm*scrollbar*thickness: 5
         XTerm*multiClickTime: 500
         XTerm*charClass:  33:48,37:48,45-47:48,64:48
         XTerm*cutNewline: off
         XTerm*cutToBeginningOfLine: off
         XTerm*titeInhibit:  on
         XTerm*ttyModes:  intr ^c erase ^? kill ^u
         XLoad*Background: gold
         XLoad*Foreground: red
         XLoad*highlight: black
         XLoad*borderWidth: 0
         emacs*Geometry:  80x65-0-0
         emacs*Background:  rgb:5b/76/86
         emacs*Foreground:  white
         emacs*Cursor:  white
         emacs*BorderColor:  white
         emacs*Font:  6x10
         <A HREF="xmag.html">xmag</A>*geometry: -0-0
         <A HREF="xmag.html">xmag</A>*borderColor:  white

     If these resources were stored in a file called  .<I>Xresources</I>
     in  your home directory, they could be added to any existing
     resources in the server with the following command:

         % <A HREF="xrdb.html">xrdb</A> -merge $HOME/.Xresources

     This is frequently how user-friendly startup  scripts  merge
     user-specific  defaults  into  any  site-wide defaults.  All
     sites are encouraged to set up convenient ways of  automati-
     cally   loading  resources.  See  the  <I>Xlib</I>  manual  section
     <I>Resource</I> <I>Manager</I> <I>Functions</I> for more information.

DIAGNOSTICS
     A wide variety of error messages are generated from  various
     programs.   The  default error handler in <I>Xlib</I> (also used by
     many toolkits) uses standard resources to construct diagnos-
     tic  messages  when  errors  occur.   The defaults for these
     messages are usually stored in &lt;<I>XRoot</I>&gt;/<I>lib</I>/<I>X11</I>/<I>XErrorDB</I>.  If
     this  file  is  not  present,  error messages will be rather
     terse and cryptic.

     When the <A HREF="X.html">X</A> Toolkit Intrinsics  encounter  errors  converting
     resource  strings  to  the  appropriate  internal format, no
     error messages are usually printed.  This is convenient when
     it  is  desirable  to  have  one  set  of resources across a
     variety of displays (e.g.  color  vs.  monochrome,  lots  of
     fonts vs. very few, etc.), although it can pose problems for
     trying to determine why an  application  might  be  failing.
     This   behavior   can  be  overridden  by  the  setting  the
     <I>StringConversionsWarning</I> resource.

     To force the <A HREF="X.html">X</A> Toolkit Intrinsics  to  always  print  string
     conversion  error messages, the following resource should be
     placed   in   the   file   that   gets   loaded   onto   the
     RESOURCE_MANAGER property using the <I><A HREF="xrdb.html">xrdb</A></I> program (frequently
     called .<I>Xresources</I> or .<I>Xres</I> in the user's home directory):

         *StringConversionWarnings: on

     To have conversion messages printed for  just  a  particular
     application,  the  appropriate  instance  name can be placed
     before the asterisk:

         <A HREF="xterm.html">xterm</A>*StringConversionWarnings: on
