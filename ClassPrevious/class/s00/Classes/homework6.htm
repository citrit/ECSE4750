<ol>
    <li>Rensselaer has been working in graphics for some years
        now. In fact, <i>Hearn and Baker's</i> Bibliography
        refers to several RPI PhD grads, such as these: <dl
        compact>
            <dt>(a) </dt>
            <dd>Michael Potmesil, </dd>
            <dt>(b) </dt>
            <dd>Indranil Chakravarty (co-author of Potmesil), </dd>
            <dt>(c) </dt>
            <dd>Al Barr, </dd>
            <dt>(d) </dt>
            <dd>Mohan Kankanhalli (co-author of WRF) </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Your task is to:</p>
        <dl compact>
            <dt>(a) </dt>
            <dd>Check the biblio and tell me where their papers
                were published. </dd>
            <dt>(b) </dt>
            <dd>Use the online library catalog to find the titles
                of their theses. </dd>
        </dl>
    </li>
    <li>Why can B and W CRTs have a higher resolution than color
        CRTs?</li>
    <li>Name two assumptions that the designers of NTSC made
        about the nature of the scenes that would be televised.</li>
    <li>Assume that a HDTV (hi definition TV) display is
        transmitting a 1000x1000 frame at 30 Hz. (In practice,
        these numbers are variable.) Assume that each primary
        color is 8 bits. How many bits per second are being
        transmitted, if there is no compression? </li>
    <li>Read the LCD web page, and tell us how the undesirable
        yellow-blue appearance of passive LCD displays was fixed
        (other than going to active). </li>
    <li>How are the two glass plates of a laptop LCD kept the
        proper distance apart? (Two words.) </li>
    <li>Suppose that you are manufacturing 1000x1000 pixel,
        active-matrix, LCDs. Suppose also that one out of one
        million of your transistors are bad. <ol>
            <li>How many transistors will each display contain? </li>
            <li>How many bad transistors will the average display
                contain? </li>
            <li>What percentage of your displays will have no bad
                transistors? (Hard). </li>
            <li>What percentage of your displays will have ten or
                more bad transistors? (HARD; requires knowing
                some probability, which is part of the
                curriculum, but not a pre-req for this course.
                Therefore this is only an enrichment question.) </li>
