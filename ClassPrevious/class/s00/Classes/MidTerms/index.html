<h1><a name="01"></a>Midterm Exam</h1>

<p>This is next Tuesday in class.  It is required.  Bring one 2-sided
8.5 inch by 11 inch crib sheet.  </p>


<h1><a name="02"></a>Sample Midterm Questions</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>
<a href="bigmidterm.pdf">Here</a>
is my file <tt>bigmidterm</tt>, the union of my midterm exams
for the last several years.   The latex source for the file is 
in /dept/ecse/graphics/Classes/19/bigmidterm.tex.
(This version is slightly updated from what I showed in class; that version is in /dept/ecse/graphics/Classes/19/o/bigmidterm1.*)  </p></li>

<p>To give you an idea of length, here is the actual Spring 99 midterm exam,
<a href="s99midterm.pdf">s99midterm.pdf</a>.  The latex source is as usual.
</p>

<li><p>There being only a finite number of electrons in the universe, this
year's test will recycle several questions.</p></li>

<li><p>Since I update the course each year, many old questions cover material
that I didn't cover this year.</p></li>

<li><p>There are no prepared answer sets, altho we are glad to answer
specific questions in class.</p></li>

<li><p>FYI, the exam original is in LaTeX.</p></li>

</ol>

<h1><a name="03"></a>Homework Postponed</h1>

<p>Since I haven't covered everything needed for the last homework,
you don't need to hand it in until next Thursday.  </p>

<h1><a name="04"></a>New Material This Class</h1>

<p>We're continuing with hardware from chapter 2.  Since the book is
so good, I won't be writing such detailed notes as before.  </p>
