<p>There are two parts to this course, practice and theory.  We will
cover many of the following subjects, depending on class interest
and how fast things go.  If an earlier topic proves more difficult
than I thought, then I spend the extra time to get it across, and
drop a later topic.  If anyone feels that I am going too slowly,
then see me for enrichment material.</p>

<H2><A>
Why Take This Course?</A>
</H2>

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>Graphics is fun.  It's got a history, since it is a takeoff from
geometry, which is at least 2500 years old.  There are pretty
pictures involved.  It's based on state-of-the-art hardware.
<P>

<DT>2.
<DD>It has applications, and is tied into the real world, and is
not just theoretical. 

<P>

<DT>3.
<DD>Nevertheless, it's not just practical stuff with no depth, but has some
theory and math also.

<P>

<DT>4.  

<DD>It teaches practical knowledge, e.g., X/Motif and Tcl/Tk,
that can lead directly to a job.  (Assuming that you pass this course)
put X-windows on your resume.  You see job ads that mention <I>X</I>
and <I>Motif</I>.

<P>
</DL>

<H2><A>
Why Not To Take This Course</A>
</H2>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>You don't like programming.
<DT>2.
<DD>You don't like documenting your programs.
<DT>3.
<DD>You don't like math.
<DT>4.
<DD>You don't like writing  exams at the official scheduled times.
</DL>


<H2><A>
Why Not Just Read Books?</A>
</H2>

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>You wouldn't really read the books on your own, now would you??
<DT>2.
<DD>RPI needs the tuition money.
<DT>3.
<DD>I supplement the book by teaching things that are too recent to
appear in textbooks yet.  There is a certain lag in the writing
and printing of any text.
<DT>4.
<DD>I present some things better than the books. For example, 
There is no
one book that teaches both general graphics at a deep level, and
also X.
<DT>5.
<DD>I combine the book with exercises designed specifically for the
Rensselaer Computing System.
<DT>6.
<DD>I bring in current events when relevant.
<DT>7.
<DD>There might be a guest lecture or two.
</DL>


<H2><A>
Prerequisites</A>
</H2> 

<P> This is a senior CSYS course, and assumes a moderate computer
maturity, represented in the catalog by ECSE-2610 (Computer Components
& Operations).  You should know some HW, but if you don't have that
specific course, don't despair.

<P>
Since there is programming in C on the workstations, you also must
know some high level language, which you can translate into a
knowledge of some C.  If you don't know what a pointer is, then
drop this course and take Computing Languages first.
A good review
book on C is Kelley &amp; Pohl, <EM>A Book on C</EM>.

<P>
Computer Graphics also assumes that you know, or be able to learn,
some basic linear algebra, up to the level of what an eigenvalue
is.

<P>
If you're uncertain about taking this course, then, by all means,
talk to me, or to previous people in it.  If there is one specific
fact that is unfamiliar, such as <I>eigenvalue</I>, then there's
no problem at all.

<I>Never in the half hour before a class</I>.
</p>


<DT><STRONG>Background</STRONG>
<DD><P>
Ever since high school, I've been doing geometry, and I have been
(constructively) hacking computers since 1966.  I was Phdded by Hahvahd
in 1978 and have been at RPI since then (except for sabbatical years)
doing graphics, CAD, and geometry algorithms, and some AI.  My
first sabbatical was at UC Berzerkley for a year, and the second
at 
the Dipartimento di Informatica e Scienze dell'Informazione,
Universita di Genova, the Dept. de Science G&#233;od&#233;sique,
Universit&#233; de Laval, Quebec City, the Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organization, Canberra, and the Institute of
Systems Science, National University of Singapore.

<P>
Various undergrad and grad projects are available from me.

<P>
Computational geometry, and graphics and CAD algorithms and data
structures are the main themes of my research.  Various data
structures for representing polygons and polyhedra, such as vertex
neighborhood sets, are designed and compared.  Algorithms for
cartographic map overlay, polygon intersection and interference
detection using set based data structures, single level grids, and no
global topology, are designed and tested.  All these algorithms are
easily parallelizable.

<P>
Applied computer security is another interest.

<P>
When not working, I hike or travel.  In summer 1997, I drove 9300
miles to the San Juan Islands and back.  During my last sabbatical
in 1992-3, I was outside the US for nine months.

<P>

<DT><STRONG>Other services that I provide for you</STRONG>
<p>
<ol>

<li><p>Bring your resume to me for suggestions.  From time to time I read
resumes with a view to hiring someone, so I have opinions on what makes
a good resume. These opinions may vary from the
Placement Office's.  Sample suggestions:  Explicitly mention major
computer systems and packages, such as X, which you know.  Don't mention
your non-academic hobbies and marital status.  
</p></li>

<li><p>If someone sends me notice of a job opening, I publicize it.
</p></li>
</ol>
 
<DT><STRONG>Extra-curricular contacts</STRONG>
<p>
<ol>

<li><p>If you see me eating lunch in the Student Union, join me, and talk
about whatever you want, such as the future of computer science.
</p></li>

<li><p>Occasionally I lead hikes in the Adirondacks or Catskills.  These
tend to be 5-10 miles, with up to 2000 feet of climbing, i.e., easy for
people in tolerable shape.  No one has gotten lost yet, at least for
very long.  (Would I lose, permanently, a paying customer?)

Attendance Policy</A>
</H3>

<P> Skipping classes is ok (except for tests and exams).  However,
remember to ask a friend what happened.  I try to write down on the
web pages anything important.  It's ok to share class attendance with
a friend who takes good notes.


<H3><A>
Lecture Notes</A>
</H3>

<P>
Since I do not lecture from notes, I do not have lecture notes to
hand out for classes that you missed, and cannot provide
individualized summaries of classes that you missed.  </p>
<P>
Nevertheless there will be a 1-line summary of each lecture on the
course web page.


<H2><A>
Labs</A>
</H2>

<P>
The labs are for me to demo SW to you, and for you to run SW like
your homeworks and term project, and ask questions.  There is no
specific prelab preparation for you to do.
You don't need to stay in the labs if you already know the stuff, but
it might be useful to come at the start to check for announcements.
If there are more students than workstations, then please pair up.
This solution is preferable to limiting the enrollment.


<H2><A>
Important Dates</A>
</H2>
Here is a summary of important dates so far.

<p>

<ul>
<li>Midterm exam on Tues Oct 19.   We will try to get you your
grades before the drop date, Oct 26.

<li>Final exam either in the final exam period, or during the last
class, if the class wishes.

</ul>



<H1><A>
Materials and Tools</A>
</H1>



<H2><A>
Handouts</A>
</H2>


<p>There will be many handouts with announcements, homeworks, and
summaries of important points.  Also, I'll hand out a graphics
patent, such as the Sutherland-Hodgman patent on graphics
clipping.</p>

<p>The handouts that I type will generally be online as HTML
files.
</p>
   

<H2><A>
Textbooks</A>
</H2>


<ol>

<li>
<p>Hearn and Baker, <I>Computer graphics, C version</I>.  This book
is recommended, but not required, if you are short of money.  I will
base the last half of the course on it, and assign some homeworks from
it.</p>


<p>You have a choice as to where to buy it.   Purchases at the
bookstore support the Student Union.  Purchases online, such as at 
<a href="http://www.varsitybooks.com">Varsitybooks.com</a>,
mentioned <a
href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,25293,00.html?owv">in this
article</a> may be cheaper.
</p>

<li> <p>Various books on X and Tcl exist, but are not required.</p>


</ol>

<H2><A>
Computers</A>
</H2>

<P>
The course computing environment will be the RCS Unix
workstations, which there are several platforms, primarily the
new SGIs in VCC-S.  Many things will also work on the Sun or IBM
workstations.  In fact I use a Sun in my office.  The main
differences between the various platforms are as follows.

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>Different screen resolutions (number of pixels).
<DT>2.
<DD>Speed.
<DT>3.
<DD>Hardware (such as the video camera) and software available
only on the SGIs.
</DL>

<P>
You may also use other workstations
available to you, if they have a compatible environment.  For example,
ECSE and CS students each have some public workstations in their
respective departments.  

<P> If you are new here at Rensselaer, then see the Academic Computing
Service page at <a
href="http://www.rpi.edu/Computing/ACShome.html">http://www.rpi.edu/Computing/ACMhome.html</a>.



<P> For info on using the SGI workstations in VCC South and JEC 3207,
see <a
href="http://www.rpi.edu/Computing/New/RCS_news/SGIhandout.html">http://www.rpi.edu/Computing/New/RCS_news/SGIhandout.html</a>.


<H2>Course Computer Files</H2>

<P>
From the RCS workstations, public files relating to this course,
such as handouts that I type, are in 
<code>/dept/ecse/graphics/</code>.  

<P>
The files from last semester are in
<code>/dept/ecse/graphics/graphics-f98/</code>, in case you'd like a
preview of possible future homeworks.  However, some things will
change this year.

<H2><A>
X Info</A>
</H2>


<H3><A>
X Books</A>
</H3>

<P>
There are now many books on X, but many of them concentrate on the
lower-level Xlib stuff, not the higher-level widgets, which I
concentrate on.  I'll take examples from a series of X books
published by O'Reilly; however the info is distributed over so
many volumes that I can't require that you buy any of them.  These
are some of the relevant volumes.

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD><I>O'Reilly volume 6A: Motif Programming Manual</I>.  We'll use
bits and pieces of this ref.  
<P>

<DT>2.
<DD>Other optional X books by O'Reilly:  Volume 3 (Window System Users
Guide) and 4 (Toolkit Intrinsics Programming Manual) of their 7
volume X window series are most interesting.  

<P>
</DL>

<P>
You can order O'Reilly books direct by calling O'Reilly
at 800-338-6887, or by visiting their Web site.



<H3><A>
X Files</A>
</H3>

<P>
There is also extensive online documentation on X.  As for
as we're concerned, X is divided into two categories: <I>Xlib</I>
and <I>Motif</I>, which are documented separately.  

<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Motif</STRONG>

<DD>See <tt>/campus/osf/motif/2.0/distrib/src/doc/</tt>, subdirs
<tt>usersGuide/</tt>, <tt>programGuide/</tt> and <tt>man/</tt>.  Each
of those has subdirs Output/draft/ascii/ and Output/draft/ps/, which
contain the same documentation in different forms.  Use the ascii
files for reading at the workstation, and the ps files for printing on
any PostScript printer.

<P>

<DT><STRONG>Xlib</STRONG>
<DD><DL COMPACT>

</DL></DL>

<P>
X is a living system, and there are many user-contributed programs.  You
can browse on the RCS system under <code>/campus/</code>.


<H2><A>
RPI Library</A>
</H2>

<P>
There are over 600 books and journals on graphics in RPI's
library.   

<H2><A>
Course Web Site</A>
</H2>

<p>There is a course web site at
<a href="http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/Courses/S99/ECSE-4750/">http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/Courses/S99/ECSE-4750/</a>.
</p>

<p>It's also reachable
from my home page, 
<a href="http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/Homepages/wrf/">http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/Homepages/wrf/</a>.  It will have
copies of all the handouts that I typed in (but not handouts
xeroxed from somewhere else).   
</p>

<P>
There may also be pointers to auxiliary files that I may not hand
out, such as FAQs and graphics files on other systems.
</p>

<H2><A>
Course Usenet Newsgroup</A>
</H2>

<P>
If the class wishes,
there can be a course newsgroup, called</p>

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<TT>rpi.courses.Spring98.Computer-Graphics</TT>
</DIV>

<p>for students to
discuss relevant issues with each other.  Nevertheless, I will
distribute official announcements by handout or email.
</p>

<P>
For a list of other relevant Usenet newsgroups, see the class web site.

<P>
I'll store  copies of some interesting files from the net, such as the
<I>comp.graphics Frequently Asked Questions</I> in the class directory.

Grading</A>
</H1>

<TITLE>Homework</TITLE>


</head>
<body>
There will be about ten homeworks, about half programming on the
Unix workstations.  The programming homework will be in the C
language.  You, and all computer engineers, don't need to know
every detail, such as tentative declarations and enums; just the
basics.  

<P>
Homework grades tend to be bimodally distributed -- often 9 or
10/10 for work handed in, but 0/10 for work not handed in.  The
homework tends to be not too difficult.  I see the homeworks like
warmup exercises for a team, or finger exercises on the piano;
everyone should be able to do them with a little work, and in
doing them will learn something.

<P>
You are free to form study groups, cooperate on the homework and
share answers.  You may also hand in group homeworks if you wish.
That is, two people may do the homeworks together and hand in one
solution with both names on it.
It is not acceptable retroactively to declare a partnership, as in
the following (only slightly) fictional message:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
``Hi, this is John Doe on Dec 10.  The reason that you're missing
ten homework grades for me is that I did them all as a team with
Jane Roe.  Unfortunately I forgot to put my name on any of them,
and yes, they're all in her handwriting, but, really, I did
contribute.''

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> You are responsible for seeing that the TA has recorded your
homework grades; it is not allowed to claim at the end of the
semester, after you see your grade, that we lost a homework.  If you
hand a homework in late, please give it to him.  We will help your
checking by making your interim grades available from time to time.



<H2><A>
Midterm Exam on Wed Feb 24</A>
</H2>

<P>
This will be in class on <B>Wed Feb 24</B>. It is required, so <EM>
plan your plant trips around it</EM>. We will give you the grades
exams, and an estimated course letter grade several days before
the drop date.

<P>
The exam will be closed book; however you may bring one 8.5"x11"
crib sheet covered with as much as you can write, print, or
xerox-reduce on.  Mechanical reproduction is ok.


<P>
How did I pick the date?  It's the latest date that lets us get
the graded exams back to you before the drop date.

<H2><A>
Term Project due Wed April 28.</A>
</H2>

<P>
You will think of, implement, and document a program relating to
graphics.  It must demonstrate both graphics input and output;
other than that it must only be legal and ethical.

<P>
This may be done by a team, and may be combined with another course's
project if you get the approval of everyone involved.

<P>
It may build on previous work, either by you or someone else, with their
permission, provided that you mention this.  For example, you may build
on software, such as <TT>xfig</TT>, posted on the net.  Since in the real
world, much more money is spent modifying existing software than writing
new software, extending an existing program is quite ok with me.

<P>
Unlike the homework, you may do the term project on any computer you
have access to, even a home computer, if it is a powerful one.  A simple
PC is probably not adequate.

<P>
The project will be due on <B>Wed April 28.</B>.  The penalty for
handing it in late will be 10% per day.  Plan to have it actually
ready earlier in case your disk crashes or account expires.  You
may pick up your projects after they are graded.

<P>
Up to half the grade may be on the documentation and examples.

<P>
There should be five old term projects on reserve in the library.


<TITLE>Real World Picky Rules</TITLE>

<body>

<P>
The term project will be unrealistic in that I will not be as
picky about formats as in the real world.  Here, for example, are
some of the National Science Foundation's proposal submission
rules, which I am subject to.

Final Exam</A>
</H2>

<P>
I will hold a vote in the first class to decide between the
following two choices.

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>There will be a 50-minute final exam in class during the
last class, Wed April 28, or
<P>

<DT>2.
<DD>There will be a 3-hour final exam during the final exam
period, at the time set by the registrar.  It
will be like the midterm, but will allow two cribsheets.  It will
be required, so <EM>don't make plane reservations</EM> before you
know its exact date, which could be as late as the afternoon of
May 7.

<P>
</DL>

<P>
The first choice means that there is one less class for 
learning new things.  However, you get finished sooner.

<P>
Whichever choice the class makes, that date will be
compulsory for the whole class.


<H2><A>
Source of Exam Questions</A>
</H2>

<P>
The exam questions tend to be short answer, and to ask for reasons
and advantages and disadvantages of something.  I try not to ask
about picky little details, but then, I might think that the fact
that the first word on page 283 of <I>Hearn</I> is ``determine''
is of global importance, while you might think it is incredibly
picky.

<P>
Where do I get exam questions?

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>From old exams; this recycles and saves electrons.  I'll
hand out a big list of previous exam questions.
<P>

<DT>2.
<DD>From homework questions.

<P>

<DT>3.
<DD>From questions asked in the review sessions before the
exams.

<P>

<DT>4.
<DD>etc etc

<P>
</DL>


<H2><A>
Individual vs Team Work</A>
</H2>

<P>
You are encouraged, but not required, to work in teams on the
homeworks and term project.  In the real world teams are often
required.  

<P>
Feel free to incorporate someone else's ideas and code, <I>but</I>
you must acknowledge that, and in the case of code, obtain their
permission if appropriate.  Failure to do this is academic
dishonesty (cheating) and will cause an F grade in the work
involved, and a report in your file.  There is a lot of free code
on the Internet that I encourage you to browse, and use in your
projects.  Civil engineers look at real bridges; computer
engineers should look at real programs.

<P>
You must do the exams individually and not communicate with anyone
other than the TA or me.


<H2><A>
General</A>
</H2>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>Each component of the grade will be worth 25%.  E.g. doing the homework
is required to get an A.  You may telephone me, or my secretary, or
leave a postcard, or visit, to get your final grade.
<P>

<DT>2.
<DD>We will periodically make our record of your grades so far available.
If you see an error, please tell us immediately.

<P>

<DT>3.
<DD>The grading is somewhat on a curve, modulated by how I feel
the class, as a whole did.

<TITLE>RPI and Computer Graphics</TITLE>


</head>
<body>

<P>
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has a long history of computer
graphics.  

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>We were the first university to require every
engineering undergrad to take some computer graphics.  That was
about 1978.  This was in the Interactive Computer Graphics Center,
founded by Mike Wozny.  (IIRC, the ICGC renamed itself to the Center for
Interactive Computer Graphics, then morphed into the Rensselaer
Design Research Center, spun off the SCOREC, and finally combined
into the New York State Center for Advanced Technology in
Automation, Robotics, and Manufacturing in Rensselaer.)
<P>

<DT>2.
<DD>While many universities use PCs and Macs, we use the more
powerful Unix workstations for much of the curriculum.  Win9x and
the PCs are catching up, but the Unix workstations are still
ahead, at least this year.

<P>

<DT>3.
<DD>The first editor of the journal <EM>IEEE Computer
Graphics and Applications</EM> was Mike Wozny, who also founded the
Center for Interactive Computer Graphics in 1978 (which later
became the Rensselaer Design Research Center and then folded into
the Design &amp; Manufacturing Institute.)

<P>

<DT>4.
<DD>The text lists several former RPI PhD students.
</dl>


<H2><A>
Other Graphics-Related Courses at RPI</A>
</H2>

<P>
The course will have little overlap with the other
graphics-related courses at RPI, such as the following.
You can easily take them all.

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD><I>Graphics &amp; Visualization:</I>  This graduate course is
taught by Tom Citriniti of Mapinfo.  It covers
advanced graphics topics such as OpenGL, VRML, Data Explorer.
<P>

<DT>2.
<DD><I>ECSE-6790 Computational Geometry:</I>  This grad course is 
taught by me when there is sufficient demand.  It covers research issues in efficient computer
geometry, as well as intro to parametric curves and surfaces.

<P>
</DL>


<H1><A>
Your Name &amp; Communicating with Us</A>
</H1>

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>Please write your name on homeworks and exams 
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>(a)
<DD>in the same way each time, and
<DT>(b)
<DD>in a form recognizably similar to your name as RPI knows it.
</DL>
Otherwise, we might record half your grades under one
name, and half under another, leading us to assign you 2 D-grades
instead of one A-grade.
<P>

<DT>2.
<DD>When emailing us, always use <I>your real name</I> and use a relevant
subject, such as <I>Graphics HW Question</I>.  We get spammed by a lot
of junk.   A message from <TT>d00d</TT> might not be read.

<P>

<DT>3.
<DD>Otherwise, if we don't reply in two days, please send it again.
</DL>

<h1>Homework 1 - Due Jan 20</h1>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>This is a test of your linear algebra knowledge.   Feel free
to refer to books to find the correct formulae.
<P>
Suppose that we have a plane in 3-D thru the points A(1,0,0),
B(0,1,0), and C(0,0,1).
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>(a)
<DD>What is its equation, in the form <I>ax</I>+<I>by</I>+<I>cz</I>+<I>d</I>=0?
<DT>(b)
<DD>Consider the line L thru the points O(0,0,0) and P(1,1,1).
Where does this line intersect the plane?
</DL>

<P>

<DT>2.
<DD>This is a test of whether you know enough C for this course.
(Last time, a few people had major problems because of this.)
The following code will copy string <code>s</code> to array <code>t</code>,
provided that a few erroneous lines are corrected.
What are the corrections and proper initializations?

<P>

<PRE>
char *s="Hello!";
char t[6];
char p, q;
p=s;
q=t;
for (;*q++ = *p++;);
</PRE>

<P>

<DT>3.
<DD>(This is a test of using <code>ftp</code> to find a file on another system, and
<code>xv</code> to display it.)

<P>
The site <a href="http://www.viewpoint.com/">http://www.viewpoint.com/</a> has many graphics files,
including some texture files like 
<a
href="ftp://avalon1.viewpoint.com/avalon/textures/tif/vege/clover01.tif">
ftp://avalon1.viewpoint.com/avalon/textures/tif/vege/clover01.tif
</a>.

</DIV>

<P>
shown here.</p>

<center>
<img src="clover01.jpg">.
</center>

<P>
Use, e.g., <code>ftp</code>  to get some other texture file, then
use <code>xv</code> (or another program if you prefer)
to display it, then save it in a PostScript file, then print that
file, as in <code>lpr clover01.ps</code> to any LaserWriter or other
printer that takes PostScript.  Do not spend money on a color
printout; B&amp;W is ok.  Write your name and the filename on the
printout and hand it in.

<P>

<DT>4.
<DD>If we're going to be learning complicated graphics in this course, it
behooves us still to be able to do the simple things.  So, this exercise
is to plot the ship NCC1701.

<P>

<code>/dept/ecse/graphics/ncc1701.data.gz</code> is a compressed file of
3,958 triangles defining the USS Enterprise.  It looks like this
when uncompressed with <TT>gunzip</TT>:
<PRE>
1.431000 0.505000 0.843000
1.572000 0.505000 0.801000
1.287000 0.505000 0.802000
1.431000 0.505000 0.843000


1.572000 0.505000 0.801000
1.595000 0.542000 0.794000
1.263000 0.542000 0.795000
1.572000 0.505000 0.801000


1.572000 0.505000 0.801000
1.263000 0.542000 0.795000
1.287000 0.505000 0.802000
1.572000 0.505000 0.801000


... and similarly for 23730 more lines
</PRE>
Each line of the file represents one vertex in the form: 
(<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>z</I>).  Four lines make one triangle; the first vertex is
repeated.  Two blank lines separate each triangle.

<P>
You may use any graphics program you please to plot the ship.  I
used <code>gnuplot</code>.
Uncompress the file into <TT>/tmp</TT>, thus:</p>

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
gunzip <code>&lt;</code> /dept/ecse/graphics/ncc1701.data.gz <code>&gt;</code> /tmp/ncc
</DIV>

<p>You may want to cut off a piece of the file for testing:
</p>

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
head -1000 /tmp/ncc <code>&gt;</code> /tmp/piece
</DIV>

<P>
Then,  in gnuplot, you should set parametric mode
thus:
<PRE>
set parametric
</PRE>
then surface plot the data file thus:
<PRE>
splot "/tmp/piece" with lines
</PRE>

<P>
When you see how to use (this part of) gnuplot, plot the file.
Then get a screendump, and hand that in.  Alternatively, Section
s:gnu gives another way to print plots.

<P>
Gnuplot shows something like this.
<img src="ncc1701.jpg">

<P>
Do not copy the whole file into your account, but read it from the
class account every time.

<P>

<DT>5.
<DD>(This is a test of your C knowledge.)  Write a C program to
rotate the <code>ncc1701.data</code> to some other angle and then plot
it again (and hand in a copy of the program and that plot).
  How do you plan to handle the
blank lines?

(or whatever).
<DT>4.
<DD>For another plot, go back to step 2>.
<DT>5.
<DD>Print your file(s) to any Postscript printer.  I think that
all the printers that you use are Postscript, but there's probably
an exception somewhere.
<PRE>
lpr plot.ps
</PRE>
<P>

<DT>6.
<DD>If you wish to include the PS file in a L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X2<SUB>e</SUB> document,
then in point 1 above, say
<PRE>
set terminal postscript eps
</PRE>
This creates an <I>Encapsulated</I> PostScript file.  You can still
print this directly, however, it won't fill the whole page.

Reading</A>
</H2>

<P>
Scan the preface and chapters 1 and 2 of the Motif Program Guide for Wed.  The
idea is to get a feel for things, not to memorize the details.
It's here:

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE="-1">
/campus/osf/motif/2.0/distrib/src/doc/programGuide/Output/draft/ascii/preface, 
ch01, ch02</FONT></TT>

<P>
or here:

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE="-1">
/campus/osf/motif/2.0/distrib/src/doc/programGuide/Output/draft/ps/preface.ps.Z, 
ch01.ps.Z, ch02.ps.Z</FONT></TT>

<P>
The ascii format can be read in an xterm window, but the ps format
looks, and prints, better.  You'll have to uncompress those files, 
with <TT>uncompress</TT>,
and then use
<TT>ghostview</TT>.
