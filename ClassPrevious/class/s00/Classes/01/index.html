<h2><a name="02"></a>Objectives</h2>

<dl compact>
    <dt>1. </dt>
    <dd>To teach graphics programming using X-Motif, a
        widely-used Graphics GUI tool, and Tcl/Tk, on the
        workstations. This will also give us a platform to
        develope applications to experiment with the algorithms
        section.</dd>
    <dt>2. </dt>
    <dd>To teach some of the algorithms and data structures of
        computer graphics, which will give you the tools to
        design your own graphics programs and systems. </dd>
</dl>

<p>There are two parts to this course, practice and theory. We
will cover many of the following subjects, depending on class
interest and how fast things go. If an earlier topic proves more
difficult than I thought, then I spend the extra time to get it
across, and drop a later topic. If anyone feels that I am going
too slowly, then see me for enrichment material.</p>

<p>The later topics in this list are less likely to be covered.

<h2><a name="03"></a>Why Take This Course?</h2>

<dl compact>
    <dt>1. </dt>
    <dd>Graphics is fun. It's got a history, since it is a
        takeoff from geometry, which is at least 2500 years old.
        There are pretty pictures involved. It's based on
        state-of-the-art hardware. </dd>
    <dt>2. </dt>
    <dd>It has applications, and is tied into the real world, and
        is not just theoretical. </dd>
    <dt>3. </dt>
    <dd>Nevertheless, it's not just practical stuff with no
        depth, but has some theory and math also. </dd>
    <dt>4. </dt>
    <dd>It teaches practical knowledge, e.g., X/Motif and Tcl/Tk,
        that can lead directly to a job. (Assuming that you pass
        this course) put X-windows on your resume. You see job
        ads that mention <i>X</i> and <i>Motif</i>. </dd>
    <dt>5. </dt>
    <dd>In the research word a picture is worth a thousand words.</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name="04"></a>Why Not To Take This Course</h2>

<dl compact>
    <dt>1. </dt>
    <dd>You don't like programming. </dd>
    <dt>2. </dt>
    <dd>You don't like documenting your programs. </dd>
    <dt>3. </dt>
    <dd>You don't like math. </dd>
    <dt>4. </dt>
    <dd>You don't like writing exams at the official scheduled
        times. </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name="05"></a>Why Not Just Read Books?</h2>

<dl compact>
    <dt>1. </dt>
    <dd>You wouldn't really read the books on your own, now would
        you?? </dd>
    <dt>2. </dt>
    <dd>RPI needs the tuition money. </dd>
    <dt>3. </dt>
    <dd>I supplement the book by teaching things that are too
        recent to appear in textbooks yet. There is a certain lag
        in the writing and printing of any text. </dd>
    <dt>4. </dt>
    <dd>I present some things better than the books. For example,
        There is no one book that teaches both general graphics
        at a deep level, and also X. </dd>
    <dt>5. </dt>
    <dd>I combine the book with exercises designed specifically
        for the Rensselaer Computing System. </dd>
    <dt>6. </dt>
    <dd>I bring in current events when relevant. </dd>
    <dt>7. </dt>
    <dd>There might be a guest lecture or two. </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name="06"></a>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>This is a senior CSYS course, and assumes a moderate computer
maturity, represented in the catalog by ECSE-2610 (Computer
Components &amp; Operations). You should know some HW, but if you
don't have that specific course, don't despair. </p>

<p>Since there is programming in C on the workstations, you also
must know some high level language, which you can translate into
a knowledge of some C. If you don't know what a pointer is, then
drop this course and take Computing Languages first. A good
review book on C is Kelley &amp; Pohl, <em>A Book on C</em>. </p>

<p>Computer Graphics also assumes that you know, or be able to
learn, some basic linear algebra, up to the level of what an
eigenvalue is. </p>

<p>If you're uncertain about taking this course, then, by all
means, talk to me, or to previous people in it. If there is one
specific fact that is unfamiliar, such as <i>eigenvalue</i>, then
there's no problem at all. </p>

    <dt><strong>Background</strong> </dt>
    <dd>I have been programming computers since 1981. My first
        program was a fortran project in which we submitted punch
        cards with our code. I am very happy that technology has
        advanced enough so that instead of dropping my program
        and scrambling it, the software I am using crashes while
        I am typing and I loose all my changes (usually 2-3 hours
        worth).<br>
        <br>
        Since 1990 I have been heavily involved with OO 3D
        computer graphics systems usd to model and simulate real
        world phenomina. This includes several CAD packages and
        programming environments.<br>
        <br>
        I also teach the ECSE course Advanced 3D Computer
        Graphics and Data Visualization in which we learn 3D
        computer graphics libraries and how to create a software
        system to store and animate a scene.</dd>
    <dt><strong>Other services that I provide for you</strong> </dt>
    <dd><ol>
            <li>I work with computers and graphics applications
                on a daily basis and at one point or another had
                to look up the most archane things. If you have a
                graphics questions most likely I have looked it
                up somewhere, so please ask<br>
                </li>
            <li>If someone sends me notice of a job opening, I

<h3><a name="13"></a>Attendance Policy</h3>

<p>Please make every attempt to make class. I usually explain
things much more in class. If there is a topic you are not
comfortable with please make that class. I also make questions on
exams reflect what was discussed in class so if you choose not to
attend please make sure you contact someone with good notes. </p>

<h3><a name="14"></a>Lecture Notes</h3>

<ol>
    <li>I plan to prepare and lecture from web pages. </li>
    <li>I may even update them in class in response to your
        questions.</li>
    <li>After class, I'll post the updated pages on the public

<h2><a name="16"></a>Important Dates</h2>

<p>Here is a summary of important dates so far. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Midterm exam on Thurs February 24. We will try to get you
        your grades before the drop date, March 6. </li>
    <li>Final exam either in the final exam period, or during the
        last class, if the class wishes. Whats the vote.</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="17"></a>Materials and Tools</h1>

<h2><a name="18"></a>Handouts</h2>

<p>There will be few handouts since most things will be on the
web. </p>

<h2><a name="19"></a>Textbooks</h2>

<ol>
    <li>For the first half of the course, I'll prepare web pages
        and sample programs. There is a lot of online info.
        Various books on X and Tcl also exist, but are not
        required.<br>
        <br>
        A good book on X is:</li>
    <li>The last half of the course, and some homeworks are based
        on Hearn and Baker, <i>Computer graphics, C version</i>.
        This book is recommended, but not required, if you are
        short of money. I haven't asked the bookstore to order it
        since we won't need it until October, and so many people
        prefer to mailorder books. If the class wishes, I'll have
        the bookstore order it. </li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="20"></a>Computers</h2>

<p>The course computing environment will be the RCS Unix
workstations, which there are several platforms, such as the
SGIs. Many things will also work on the Sun or IBM workstations.
In fact I use a Sun in my office. The main differences between
the various platforms are as follows. </p>

<dl compact>
    <dt>1. </dt>
    <dd>Different screen resolutions (number of pixels). </dd>
    <dt>2. </dt>
    <dd>Speed. </dd>
    <dt>3. </dt>
    <dd>Hardware (such as the video camera) and software
        available only on the SGIs. </dd>
</dl>

<p>You may also use other workstations available to you, if they
have a compatible environment. For example, ECSE and CS students
each have some public workstations in their respective
departments. </p>

<p>If you are new here at Rensselaer, then see the Academic
Computing Service page at <a
href="http://www.rpi.edu/Computing/ACShome.html">http://www.rpi.edu/Computing/ACMhome.html</a>.
</p>

<p>For info on using the SGI workstations in JEC 3207, see <a
href="http://www.rpi.edu/Computing/New/RCS_news/SGIhandout.html">http://www.rpi.edu/Computing/New/RCS_news/SGIhandout.html</a>.
You may also use LessTif, a Motif clone. See their <a
href="http://www.lesstif.org/" target="_top">Home page</a> </p>

<h2><a name="21"></a>Course Computer Files</h2>

<ol>
    <li>The course homepage may be accessed various ways: from my
        home page, and soon from the ECSE and the RPI course
        lists. </li>
    <li>From the RCS workstations, public files relating to this
        course, such as these web pages, are in <code>/dept/ecse/graphics/</code>.
    </li>
    <li>The files from last semester are in <code>/dept/ecse/graphics/graphics-s00/</code>,
        in case you'd like a preview of possible future
        homeworks. However, some things will change this year. </li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="22"></a>X Info</h2>

<h3><a name="23"></a>X Books</h3>

<p>There are now many books on X, but many of them concentrate on
the lower-level Xlib stuff, not the higher-level widgets, which I
concentrate on. Perhaps the best were a series of X books
published by O'Reilly. Unfortunately they are now out of print. I
take some examples from them; however the info is distributed
over so many volumes that I can't require that you buy any of
them, even if they were in print. In any case, these are some of
the relevant volumes. </p>

<dl compact>
    <dt>1. </dt>
    <dd><i>O'Reilly volume 6A: Motif Programming Manual</i>.
        We'll use bits and pieces of this ref. </dd>
    <dt>2. </dt>
    <dd>Other optional X books by O'Reilly: Volume 3 (Window
        System Users Guide) and 4 (Toolkit Intrinsics Programming
        Manual) of their 7 volume X window series are most
        interesting.</dd>

<h3><a name="24"></a>X Files</h3>

<p>There is also extensive online documentation on X. As for as
we're concerned, X is divided into two categories: <i>Xlib</i>
and <i>Motif</i>, which are documented separately. </p>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>Motif</strong> </dt>
    <dd>See <tt>/campus/osf/motif/2.0/distrib/src/doc/</tt>,
        subdirs <tt>usersGuide/</tt>, <tt>programGuide/</tt> and <tt>man/</tt>.
        Each of those has subdirs Output/draft/ascii/ and
        Output/draft/ps/, which contain the same documentation in
        different forms. Use the ascii files for reading at the
        workstation, and the ps files for printing on any
        PostScript printer. </dd>

                and <tt>/campus/X11/R5/core/1.0/common/man/*/*</tt>
                . They can probably be viewed thus: <pre>

ptroff -man /campus/X11/R6/core/1.0/@sys/man/mann/appres.n
</pre>
                <p>depending on whether nroff and ptroff are
                installed on your system. </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>3. </dt>
            <dd>There is some other documentation in <tt>/campus/X11/R6/core/1.0/distrib/contrib/doc/papers/tutorials/</tt>
                . </dd>
        </dl>

<p>X is a living system, and there are many user-contributed
programs. You can browse on the RCS system under <code>/campus/</code>.
</p>

<h2><a name="25"></a>RPI Library</h2>

<p>There are over 600 books and journals on graphics in RPI's
library. </p>

<h2><a name="26"></a>Course Usenet Newsgroup</h2>

<p>If the class wishes, there can be a course newsgroup, called</p>

<p align="center"><tt>rpi.courses.Spring00.Computer-Graphics</tt>
</p>

<p>for students to discuss relevant issues with each other.
Nevertheless, I will distribute official announcements by web
page or email. </p>

<p>I'll store copies of some interesting files from the net, such
as the <i>comp.graphics Frequently Asked Questions</i> in the
class directory. </p>

<h1><a name="27"></a>Grading</h1>

<p>There will be about ten homeworks, about half programming on
the Unix workstations. The programming homework will be in the C
language. You, and all computer engineers, don't need to know
every detail, such as tentative declarations and enums; just the
basics. </p>

<p>Homework grades tend to be bimodally distributed -- often 9 or
10/10 for work handed in, but 0/10 for work not handed in. The
homework tends to be not too difficult. I see the homeworks like
warmup exercises for a team, or finger exercises on the piano;
everyone should be able to do them with a little work, and in
doing them will learn something. </p>

<p>You are free to form study groups, cooperate on the homework
and share answers. You may also hand in group homeworks if you
wish. That is, two people may do the homeworks together and hand
in one solution with both names on it. It is not acceptable
retroactively to declare a partnership, as in the following (only
slightly) fictional message: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>``Hi, this is John Doe on Dec 10. The reason that you're
    missing ten homework grades for me is that I did them all as
    a team with Jane Roe. Unfortunately I forgot to put my name
    on any of them, and yes, they're all in her handwriting, but,
    really, I did contribute.'' </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are responsible for seeing that the TA has recorded your
homework grades; it is not allowed to claim at the end of the
semester, after you see your grade, that we lost a homework. If
you hand a homework in late, please give it to him. We will help
your checking by making your interim grades available from time
to time. </p>

<h2><a name="28"></a>Midterm Exam on Thurs Feb 24</h2>

<p>This will be in class. It is required, so <em>plan your plant
trips around it</em>. We will give you the grades exams, and an
estimated course letter grade several days before the drop date.
The exam will be closed book; however you may bring one
8.5&quot;x11&quot; crib sheet covered with as much as you can
write, print, or xerox-reduce on. Mechanical reproduction is ok. </p>

<p>How did I pick the date? It's the latest date that lets us get
the graded exams back to you before the drop date. </p>

<h2><a name="29"></a>Term Project due Tues Apr 25.</h2>

<p>You will think of, implement, and document a program relating
to graphics. It must demonstrate both graphics input and output;
other than that it must only be legal and ethical. </p>

<p>This may be done by a team, and may be combined with another
course's project if you get the approval of everyone involved. </p>

<p>It may build on previous work, either by you or someone else,
with their permission, provided that you mention this. For
example, you may build on software, such as <tt>xfig</tt>, posted
on the net. Since in the real world, much more money is spent
modifying existing software than writing new software, extending
an existing program is quite ok with me. </p>

<p>Unlike the homework, you may do the term project on any
computer you have access to, even a home computer, if it is a
powerful one.</p>

<p>The penalty for handing the project in late will be 10% per
day. Plan to have it actually ready earlier in case your disk
crashes or account expires. You may pick up your projects after
they are graded. </p>

<p>Up to half the grade may be on the documentation and examples.
</p>

<p>I may make some old projects available as examples. </p>

<p>The term project will be unrealistic in that I will not be as
picky about formats as in the real world. Here, for example, are
some of the National Science Foundation's proposal submission
rules, which I am subject to. </p>

    <p><font size="2">Proposals received on or before the target
    date or postmarked on or before the deadline date will be
    accepted for review. </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">CONFORMANCE WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPOSAL
    PREPARATION: </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">It is important that all proposals conform
    to the instructions provided in this Section and the Proposal
    Forms Kit. Conformance is required and will be strictly
    enforced unless a deviation has been approved. Proposals that
    are not consistent with these instructions may be returned
    without further consideration by NSF. Particular attention
    will be given to proposal length, content and formatting,
    including the page limit on the Project Description, page
    limitations on other proposal sections, and the use of
    Appendices. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Each section of the proposal must be
    separately paginated and include both the section and page
    number on the bottom center of each page (e.g., C-1, C-2).
    The proposal must be assembled in the following sequence: </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Proposals must be stapled in the upper
    left-hand corner, but otherwise unbound, and with 2.5-cm
    margins at the top, bottom and on each side. The type size
    must be clear and readily legible, in standard size which is
    10 to 12 points. (No smaller than 10 point font size may be
    used.) If constant spacing is used, there should be no more
    than 12 characters per 2.5-cm, whereas proportional spacing
    should provide no more than an average of 15 characters per
    2.5-cm. </font></p>

<h2><a name="30"></a>Final Exam</h2>

<p>I will hold a vote in the first class to decide between the
following two choices. </p>

<dl compact>
    <dt>1. </dt>
    <dd>There will be a 80-minute final exam in class during the
        last class, Thurs Apr 27, or </dd>
    <dt>2. </dt>
    <dd>There will be a 3-hour final exam during the final exam
        period, at the time set by the registrar. It will be like
        the midterm, but will allow two cribsheets. It will be
        required, so <em>don't make plane reservations</em>
        before you know its exact date, which could be as late as
        the afternoon of May 5. </dd>
</dl>

<p>The first choice means that there is one less class for
learning new things. However, you get finished sooner. </p>

<p>Whichever choice the class makes, that date will be compulsory
for the whole class. </p>

<h2><a name="31"></a>Source of Exam Questions</h2>

<p>The exam questions tend to be short answer, and to ask for
reasons and advantages and disadvantages of something. I try not
to ask about picky little details, but then, I might think that
the fact that the first word on page 283 of <i>Hearn</i> is
``determine'' is of global importance, while you might think it
is incredibly picky. </p>

<p>Where do I get exam questions? </p>

<dl compact>
    <dt>1. </dt>
    <dd>From old exams; this recycles and saves electrons. I'll
        hand out a big list of previous exam questions. </dd>
    <dt>2. </dt>
    <dd>From homework questions. </dd>
    <dt>3. </dt>
    <dd>From questions asked in the review sessions before the
        exams. </dd>
    <dt>4. </dt>
    <dd>etc etc </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name="32"></a>Individual vs Team Work</h2>

<p>You are encouraged, but not required, to work in teams on the
homeworks and term project. In the real world teams are often
required. </p>

<p>Feel free to incorporate someone else's ideas and code, <i>but</i>
you must acknowledge that, and in the case of code, obtain their
permission if appropriate. Failure to do this is academic
dishonesty (cheating) and will cause an F grade in the work
involved, and a report in your file. There is a lot of free code
on the Internet that I encourage you to browse, and use in your
projects. Civil engineers look at real bridges; computer
engineers should look at real programs. </p>

<p>You must do the exams individually and not communicate with
anyone other than the TA or me. </p>

<h2><a name="33"></a>General</h2>

<dl compact>
    <dt>1. </dt>
    <dd>Each component of the grade will be worth 25%. E.g. doing
        the homework is required to get an A. You may telephone
        me, or my secretary, or leave a postcard, or visit, to
        get your final grade. </dd>
    <dt>2. </dt>
    <dd>We will periodically make our record of your grades so
        far available. If you see an error, please tell us
        immediately. </dd>
    <dt>3. </dt>
    <dd>The grading is somewhat on a curve, modulated by how I
        feel the class, as a whole did. </dd>

<h1><a name="34"></a>Background Info</h1>

<p>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has a long history of
computer graphics. </p>

<dl compact>
    <dt>1. </dt>
    <dd>We were the first university to require every engineering
        undergrad to take some computer graphics. That was about
        1978. This was in the Interactive Computer Graphics
        Center, founded by Mike Wozny. (IIRC, the ICGC renamed
        itself to the Center for Interactive Computer Graphics,
        then morphed into the Rensselaer Design Research Center,
        spun off the SCOREC, and finally combined into the New
        York State Center for Advanced Technology in Automation,
        Robotics, and Manufacturing in Rensselaer.) </dd>
    <dt>2. </dt>
    <dd>While many universities use PCs and Macs, we use the more
        powerful Unix workstations for much of the curriculum.
        Win9x and the PCs are catching up, but the Unix
        workstations are still ahead, at least this year. </dd>
    <dt>3. </dt>
    <dd>The first editor of the journal <em>IEEE Computer
        Graphics and Applications</em> was Mike Wozny, who also
        founded the Center for Interactive Computer Graphics in
        1978 (which later became the Rensselaer Design Research
        Center and then folded into the Design &amp;
        Manufacturing Institute.) </dd>
    <dt>4. </dt>
    <dd>The text lists several former RPI PhD students. </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name="35"></a>Other Graphics-Related Courses at RPI</h2>

<p>The course will have little overlap with the other
graphics-related courses at RPI, such as the following. You can
easily take them all. </p>

<dl compact>
    <dt>1. </dt>
    <dd><i>Graphics &amp; Visualization:</i> This graduate course
        is taught by Tom Citriniti of Mapinfo. It covers advanced
        graphics topics such as OpenGL, VRML, Data Explorer. </dd>
    <dt>2. </dt>
    <dd><i>ECSE-6790 Computational Geometry:</i> This grad course
        is taught by me when there is sufficient demand. It
        covers research issues in efficient computer geometry, as
        well as intro to parametric curves and surfaces. </dd>
</dl>

<h1><a name="36"></a>Your Name &amp; Communicating with Us</h1>

<dl compact>
    <dt>1. </dt>
    <dd>Please write your name on homeworks and exams <dl compact>
            <dt>(a) </dt>
            <dd>in the same way each time, and </dd>
            <dt>(b) </dt>
            <dd>in a form recognizably similar to your name as
                RPI knows it. </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Otherwise, we might record half your grades under one
        name, and half under another, leading us to assign you 2
        D-grades instead of one A-grade. </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>2. </dt>
    <dd>When emailing us, always use <i>your real name</i> and
        use a relevant subject, such as <i>Graphics HW Question</i>.
        We get spammed by a lot of junk. A message from <tt>d00d</tt>
        might not be read. </dd>
    <dt>3. </dt>
    <dd>Otherwise, if we don't reply in two days, please send it

<h1><a name="37"></a>Homework 1 - Due Jan 18</h1>

<dl compact>
    <dt>1. </dt>
    <dd>This is a test of your linear algebra knowledge. Feel
        free to refer to books to find the correct formulae. <p>Suppose
        that we have a plane in 3-D thru the points A(1,0,1),
        B(0,1,0), and C(0,0,1). </p>

            </dd>
            <dt>(b) </dt>
            <dd>Consider the line L thru the points O(0,0,0) and
                P(1,1,1). Where does this line intersect the
                plane? </dd>
        </dl>
    </dd>
    <dt>2. </dt>
    <dd>This is a test of whether you know enough C for this
        course. (Last time, a few people had major problems
        because of this.) The following code will copy string <code>s</code>
        to array <code>t</code>, provided that a few erroneous
        lines are corrected. What are the corrections and proper
        initializations? <pre>
char *s=&quot;Hello!&quot;;
char t[6];
char p, q;
p=s;
q=t;
for (;*q++ = *p++;);
</pre>
    </dd>
    <dt>3. </dt>
    <dd>(This is a test of using <code>ftp</code> to find a file
        on another system, and <code>xv</code> to display it.) <p>The
        site <a href="http://www.viewpoint.com/">http://www.viewpoint.com/</a>
        has many graphics files, including some texture files
        like <a

        <p>shown here.</p>
        <p><img src="clover01.jpg" width="256" height="256">. </p>
        <p>Use, e.g., <code>ftp</code> to get some other texture
        file, then use <code>xv</code> (or another program if you
        prefer) to display it, then save it in a PostScript file,
        then print that file, as in <code>lpr clover01.ps</code>
        to any LaserWriter or other printer that takes
        PostScript. Do not spend money on a color printout;
        B&amp;W is ok. Write your name and the filename on the
        printout and hand it in. </p>

    <dd>If we're going to be learning complicated graphics in
        this course, it behooves us still to be able to do the
        simple things. So, this exercise is to plot the ship
        NCC1701. <p><code>/dept/ecse/graphics/ncc1701.data.gz</code>
        is a compressed file of 3,958 triangles defining the USS
        Enterprise. It looks like this when uncompressed with <tt>gunzip</tt>:

</pre>
        <p>Each line of the file represents one vertex in the
        form: (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>). Four lines make one
        triangle; the first vertex is repeated. Two blank lines
        separate each triangle. </p>
        <p>You may use any graphics program you please to plot
        the ship. I used <code>gnuplot</code>. Uncompress the
        file into <tt>/tmp</tt>, thus:</p>
        <p>gunzip <code>&lt;</code>
        /dept/ecse/graphics/ncc1701.data.gz <code>&gt;</code>
        /tmp/ncc </p>
        <p>You may want to cut off a piece of the file for
        testing: </p>
        <p>head -1000 /tmp/ncc <code>&gt;</code> /tmp/piece </p>
        <p>Then, in gnuplot, you should set parametric mode thus:
        </p>
        <pre>
set parametric
</pre>
        <p>then surface plot the data file thus: </p>
        <pre>
splot &quot;/tmp/piece&quot; with lines
</pre>
        <p>When you see how to use (this part of) gnuplot, plot
        the file. Then get a screendump, and hand that in.
        Alternatively, Section s:gnu gives another way to print
        plots. </p>
        <p>Gnuplot shows something like this. <img
        src="ncc1701.jpg" width="359" height="252"> </p>
        <p>Do not copy the whole file into your account, but read
        it from the class account every time. </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>5. </dt>
    <dd>(This is a test of your C knowledge.) Write a C program
        to rotate the <code>ncc1701.data</code> to some other
        angle and then plot it again (and hand in a copy of the
