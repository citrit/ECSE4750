<h1><a name="01"></a>Computer Engineering News (Enrichment)</h1>

<p>Comdex, perhaps the biggest annual computer show, was last week.
Here's a summary.

<h1><a name="02"></a>ECSE-6800 Advanced  3-D Computer Graphics and Visualization - S00 Course</h1>

<p>There are openings for motivated students who want to learn more
about 3D computer graphics, visualization, and animation.  The course
Advanced Computer Graphics and Data Visualization is being offered
this semester as a studio course. In this class you will learn, first
hand, how to create 3D animations and simulations using the latest
Object Oriented technologies C++ and Java. Also we will be using
OpenGL as the graphics API, a proven indsutry standard available on
all computing platforms.  </p>

<p>The new studio format allows you to learn this technology, ask
questions, and work through difficult topics in class. The use of Java
will allow for cross platform capabilities and give you the skills
necessary for the working world.  Please respond to this email if you
are interested. I need to have a count of interested students as soon
as possible.<BR><BR>To see more about what you will learn check out
the term projects from previous years at: </p>

</p>

<p>Take a look and see if this is what skill you feel is important in
todays graphics world.  </p>

<p>(Tom worked at RPI's computer center for years, then moved on to
Mapinfo.  I recommend this as an excellent followon course for people
who still like Computer Graphics.  /WRF) </p>


<h1><a name="03"></a>Popup Windows in X (Enrichment)</h1>

In response to a question, I wrote <a href="xpopup.c">xpopup.c</a>,
which creates a general popup window, which can contain any children
you want.  Here it has three label widgets.  You can't use the popup
dialog box for this.  It is a specific convenience widget, and cannot
be generalized with extra kids etc.

<h1><a name="04"></a>Microsoft Trial Findings (Enrichment)</h1>

<h1><a name="05"></a>Homework 10 - Due Thurs Dec 2</h1>

<ol>

<li>  <p>One advantage of homogeneous coordinates is that points at
<em>infinity</em> can be represented.  What is the homogeneous coordinate
representation for the point at <em>infinity</em> on the line <em>y=x+2</em>?
(Might require thinking.)
</p>


<li>
<p>For a perspective projection from the
origin to the projection plane at <em>x=5</em>.
</p>

<ol type=a>

<li><p>Calculate the 4x4 homogeneous matrix.</p></li>


<li> <p>Where would these Cartesian points project to?  </p>

<ol type=i>
<li> <em>(1,0,3)</em>
<li> <em>(1,1,4)</em>
<li> <em>(0,1,5)</em>
</ol>
<p>
</p>

<li>
<p>What point would the infinite homogeneous point (1,2,3,0) project
onto?
</p>

</ol>

<li> <p>Why should you clip before projecting an object?</p>


<li><p>How does the Sutherland-Hodgman patent represent vertices?</p></li>

<li><p>What word does the patent's claims use to describe the number
of individual processing units?  </p></li>

<li><p>Draw an example where the original polygon is connected, but the
clipped result isn't.
</p></li>

</ol>

<h1><a name="06"></a>Rendering Pipline</h1>

<p>Today we're seeing some details of the rendering pipeline, such as
the series of pictures in <em>Foley</em>.  </p>
