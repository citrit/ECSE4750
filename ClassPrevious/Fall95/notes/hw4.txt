Homework 4
Due: December 5, 1995

This homework requires you to use the VTK library in order to load and display a MRI data file. The template Makefile and data files are in:

	~citrit/public/VisClass/C++/hw4

You need to create source that will load the data file into a Scalar object and create a pipeline to render an isosurface. The objects you will need are:

	vtkRenderMaster	vtkActor	
	vtkRenderWindow	vtkStructuredPoints
	vtkRenderer	vtkShortScalars
	vtkMarchingCubes	vtkPolyMapper
	vtkRenderWindowInteractor

All these objects are described in the text in the man pages at the end of the book. There are example programs that use the VTK library in:

	/locker/44/000644/vtk1.0/examples/cc

directory. Look through these to get a feel for how to use the objects and to create the dependancy pipeline. The data file is called MRIdata.bin and 	it contains a subsampled version of an MRI scan of a human head. It is a 64 x 64 x 27 regularly spaced grid. The data values in the file are shorts and are in row major order.

Use 225.0 as the initial isosurface value, this should render a recognizable image.

Please shar up only your source code. Some people sent me the object code in the last homework and shar did not work.  Simply do a "make clean" before archiving and mailing your code. The Makefile's will place your object code in the /tmp directory, remeber to run it by using /tmp/hw4. If you are having problems with space, please see me.
